This caused him to go into shock and cardiac arrest, leading to his death minutes later.\n\nGiven this sequence of events, a typical person would likely conclude that John's long-term exposure to asbestos in the workplace caused his premature lung cancer, and that the medication error at the hospital was not the primary cause of his death. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Did long-term exposure to asbestos cause John's premature death?\" would be Yes, from the perspective of a typical person.", "auto_correct": true}, {"target": "Yes", "output": "To answer this question, let's go through the details step-by-step:\n\nThe key information provided is:\n- Customers can receive a free sample if they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC OR they are subscribed to the GC email list.\n- Laurie has previously purchased coffee beans from GC, and she is subscribed to the GC email list.\n- Laurie checks that she is still subscribed to the email list, and does not change her subscription status.\n- Because Laurie meets at least one of the criteria (previous purchase or email subscription), she receives a free sample.\n\nBased on this, a typical person would conclude that Laurie received the free sample because she had previously purchased coffee beans from GC, not because she did not change her email subscription status.
