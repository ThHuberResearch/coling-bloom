Ball Swap Game:**\n\n- In the first scenario, Alice, Bob, and Claire play a game where they swap balls. The final outcome is that Bob has the yellow ball. This is because the sequence of swaps results in the balls being moved around until Bob has the yellow ball.\n\n**2. Ball Swap Game with Different Balls:**\n\n- In the second scenario, Alice, Bob, and Claire play a similar game but with different balls. The final outcome is that Alice has the pink ball. This is due to the sequence of swaps again causing the balls to move around until Alice has the pink ball.\n\n**3. Dance Exchange:**\n\n- In the third scenario, Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers participating in a square dance. The final outcome is that Alice is dancing with Patrick. This is because the sequence of swaps results in Alice and Bob switching partners, followed by Claire and Bob switching partners, and finally Bob and Alice switching partners again.\n\n**4. White Elephant Gift Exchange:**\n\n- In the final scenario, Alice, Bob, and Claire are participating in a white elephant gift exchange. The final outcome is that Alice has the purple present. This is because the sequence of swaps causes the gifts to be exchanged among the participants until Alice has the purple present.\n\n**The key takeaway:**\n\n- The outcome of each scenario is determined by the sequence of swaps that occur.\n- The order in which the swaps happen is crucial for determining the final positions of the objects or the participants.\n- By carefully analyzing the sequence of swaps, one can predict the final outcome of each scenario.",

Then, it iterates over the initial positions and checks if the object has already been swapped. If it has not, the object keeps its original position. If it has already been swapped, the object's position is swapped with the object that was originally in that position. Finally, the function returns the final positions of the objects.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nThe code above shows three examples of how to use the `find_final_positions` function.

Ball Exchange with Different Colours:**\n\n- Same as above, but consider the different colours of the balls instead of their positions.\n- Track the movement of each colour of ball separately.\n- At the end, identify the colour of ball that each player will have.\n\n**3. Dancers' Switch:**\n\n- Analyze the sequence of switches between dancers and their partners.\n- Keep track of which dancer is paired with whom at each stage.\n- At the end, identify the dancer who will be paired with the desired partner.\n\n**4. Gift Exchange:**\n\n- As in the previous scenarios, analyze the sequence of swaps and track the movement of gifts.\n- At the end, identify the gift that each person will have.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n- Break down the sequence of swaps into smaller steps.\n- Identify the objects that are exchanged in each swap.\n- Keep track of the movement of objects or colours across the steps.\n- In the final step, consider the final positions or ownership of objects.\n\nPlease note that the provided text describes the scenarios and solutions in detail, therefore I haven't included my own solutions in this answer.",
