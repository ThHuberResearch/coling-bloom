The penguins in the table are: Louis (7, 50, 11), Bernard (5, 80, 13), Vincent (9, 60, 11), and Gwen (8, 70, 15).\n3. We then add a new penguin to the table: James (12, 90, 12).\n4. The question asks: How many penguins are less than 8 years old?\n5. Looking at the ages, the penguins less than 8 years old are: Louis (7) and Bernard (5).\n6. Therefore, the answer is (B) 2 penguins are less than 8 years old.\n\nNow, let's move to the next question:\n\n1. The question asks: Which is the youngest penguin?\n2. Looking at the ages, the youngest penguin is Bernard, who is 5 years old.\n3. Therefore, the answer is (B) Bernard.\n\nNow, let's move to the next question:\n\n1. The question asks: What is the name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order?\n2. Sorting the names alphabetically, we get: Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.\n3. The second penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Gwen.\n4. Therefore, the answer is (D) Gwen.\n\nNow, let's move to the final question:\n\n1. The question states that we delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\n2. The penguins remaining in the table are: Louis (7, 50, 11), Vincent (9, 60, 11), Gwen (8, 70, 15), and James (12, 90, 12).\n3. The question asks: What is the cumulated weight of the penguins?\n4. Summing up the weights of the remaining penguins, we get:\n   - Louis: 11 kg\n   - Vincent: 11 kg\n   - Gwen: 15 kg\n   - James: 12 kg\n5. The cumulated weight of the penguins is 11 + 11 + 15 + 12 = 49 kg.\n6. Therefore, the answer is (B) 49.",
