Elias Lindholm is a Swedish professional ice hockey player who plays in the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\n2. Beating the buzzer refers to scoring a game-winning or game-tying shot at the last second of a game.\n\nThis is a common occurrence in basketball, where players try to beat the shot clock or game clock by scoring a last-second shot. However, it can also happen in ice hockey, where players may score a goal just before the final buzzer sounds, ending the game.\n\nTherefore, the sentence \"Elias Lindholm beat the buzzer\" is a plausible one, as it describes a common occurrence in ice hockey, where a player scores a goal right before the end of the game.\n\nIn summary, the sentence is plausible because:\n- Elias Lindholm is an ice hockey player, and\n- Beating the buzzer is a valid and common occurrence in ice hockey.",

Sean Couturier is a Canadian ice hockey player who plays in the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\n2. \"Maradona\" refers to a famous move in association football (soccer) made popular by the Argentine soccer player Diego Maradona. It involves dribbling the ball by weaving it between the legs of the opposing player.\n\n3. In ice hockey, there is no \"Maradona\" move or similar dribbling technique between the legs of a defender. Ice hockey is played on ice with skates, sticks, and a puck, unlike association football which is played on grass with a ball.\n\nTherefore, the sentence \"Sean Couturier maradona'd the defender\" is not plausible in the context of an ice hockey game. The action described does not align with the rules and techniques of the sport of ice hockey.\n\nIn summary, this sentence is not plausible, as the \"Maradona\" move is specific to soccer and does not translate to the sport of ice hockey that Sean Couturier plays.",
