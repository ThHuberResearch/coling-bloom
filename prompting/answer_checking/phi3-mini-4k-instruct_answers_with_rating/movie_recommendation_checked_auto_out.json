The movie deals with social issues and family dynamics, not crime or drama themes. So it's not a match.\n\n(B) Lost and Delirious: This romantic comedy-drama film was released in 2002, directed by John Curran. The primary focus of the movie is life's regrets and lost dreams with only a side commentary on friendship and romance. The crime or drama element is missing, as well as overall tone, so it's not a match.\n\n(C) People I Know: This film is a British-American romantic comedy-drama released in 2004. It revolves around the lives and romantic relationships of three people living in New York City. There\u2019s a superficial resemblance in terms of the time frame, but there are differences in genre and overall themes, making it not a perfect match.\n\n(D) Braveheart: This 1995 historical war drama movie, directed by and starring Mel Gibson, focuses on the events leading up to and during the First War of Scottish Independence. So, it doesn't share the crime, drama, or black-comedy genres.\n\nFrom our analysis, \"People I Know\" (C) seems the closest match since it shares a similar time frame and genre (romantic comedy-drama) even though it belongs to a different production country.",

The choice here is quite interesting. While it does feature crime as a central theme, its comedic style makes it great to compare with Monty Python and the Holy Grail's comedic approach.\n\n(B) The Machinist (drama, drama, psychological thriller; 2004): This psychological drama follows the story of a reclusive factory worker who exhibits d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu symptoms and starts experiencing amnesia. While it does not entirely match the crime/drama genre, it does have overlapping themes of mystery and narrative style with Pi.\n\n(C) Yes Man (comedy, romance, drama; 2008): Although primarily a comedy, it is a film adaptation of a novel. The plot revolves around a man following the advice to say yes to opportunities, resulting in a whirlwind of unexpected consequences. While none of the given films can be directly compared to Yes Man, it lacks the serious and dramatic tone.\n\n(D) Perfect Sense (drama, romance, thriller; 2011): This mystery thriller explores alternate realities and perceptions concerning smell, taste, and touch, with a physically and emotionally challenging experience.
