The idea is to divide the input sequence into smaller parts recursively until only one item remains. For each part, we need to make sure that it is properly bracketed. We can do this by checking whether the brackets are balanced.\n\nOn each recursive call, we process the left part of the input up to the closing parentheses. We check whether it is properly bracketed. If not, we compute the opening and closing brackets to be added and apply that to the left part recursively. If it is properly bracketed, we move on to the right part of the input. We do the same for the right part recursively.\n\nIf we reach the end of the input, it means that the input is properly bracketed. We can reconstruct the original sequence by popping out the closing brackets off the stack in reverse order.\n\nHere's a possible implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Pair:\n    def __init__(self, val, left, right):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\nclass Stack:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data = []\n    \n    def push(self, elem):\n        self.data.append(elem)\n    \n    def pop(self):\n        return self.data.pop()\n    \n    def size(self):\n        return len(self.data)\n\ndef solve(input):\n    brackets = []\n    brackets.append([1])\n    n = 0\n    for i in input:\n        if i == '(' or i == '[' or i == '{':\n            brackets.append([1])\n            brackets.append([1])\n            n += 1\n        elif i == ')' or i == ']' or i == '}':\n            while brackets[-1][0] < 1:\n                brackets.pop()\n            brackets.pop()\n            brackets.pop()\n            n -= 1\n        else:\n            brackets[-1][0] += 1\n            brackets.append([naught])\n    while brackets[-1][0] < 1:\n        brackets.pop()\n    brackets.pop()\n    answer = []\n    while brackets[0][0] == 1:\n        answer.insert(0, brackets[0][1])\n        brackets.pop(0)\n    while brackets:\n        answer.append(brackets.pop()[1])\n    return answer\n\ndef complete_sequence(input):\n    solved_part = solve(input)\n    if solved_part[-1][0] == 1:\n        return complete_sequence(input[1:])\n    else:\n        return complete_sequence(input[1:])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print(complete_sequence('< [ ] { < ( ) > } [ ] ( { } &lt; ( [ ( ) { } .')\n```\n\nThe output should be \"[ ) ( { } ]\" for the given input.",

You can start with the target node and recursively traverse all of its neighbors and their neighbors, and so on, following these paths until you reach the source node. By keeping track of all the distinct paths that you find during the search, you can generate all possible paths from the source node to the target node.\n\nYou can also use backtracking to generate all possible paths. In this approach, you start with the target node and recursively traverse all of its neighbors and their neighbors, and so on. At each step, you can either continue with the current path or backtrack and choose a different neighbor, effectively exploring all possible paths leading from the current node. By going down each possible path until you reach the source node, you can generate all possible paths from the source node to the target node.\n\nBoth approaches have time complexity O(n^n), where n is the number of nodes in the graph, so they may be too slow for large graphs. In that case, you may need to use a hybrid algorithm or",

Now let's discuss how to implement Topological Sorting for solving the current problem.\nIn this approach, we first sort the elements of the input string in the order of their occurrence in the string.\nThen we traverse the sorted elements of the input string to identify the number of opening and closing parentheses separately.\nWe will set up two variables, one to keep track of the number of opening parentheses and one to keep track of the number of closing parentheses.\nWe will initially set both variables to 0.\nAs we traverse the sorted elements, we will add or subtract the number of opening or closing parentheses respectively as we come across each opening and closing parentheses.\nWe will keep a count of the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses to ensure that we have closed all the opening parentheses before moving on.\nHowever, we will only add closing parentheses when we come across them to ensure that we do not have any extra closures or unwarranted cases.\nAs soon as the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses becomes negligible, we can close the input string.\nThus, with these two strategies in place, we can easily solve the problem. We have discussed these strategies, and now it\u2019s time to apply the Topological Sort to the input string. \nAs discussed, we first need to sort the input string properly. Once sorted, we can use the help of the stack to unravel the problem. Now we will focus on two cases: the opening and closing parentheses are valid, or they are not. If valid, we can traverse the stack-top, pair up the parentheses, and close the parentheses. If invalid, we cannot pair up the parenthesis without taking out the input",

For example, adding a \"$\" in the input may break this approach.\n\nLet's try to solve this general version of the problem by generalizing this approach.\n\nWe did not use deep math, and we do not need to use it. However, concepts [from math] are useful to understand:\n<br>- Dynamic programming with memoization\n<br>- Binary Recurrences\n\nLet's generalize this approach.\n\nLet's introduce an index variable k to represent the current index in the input string. We will use it to read the input character by character and add it to the \"on\" string accordingly. The variable H will be used to represent the stack of the right side of the parentheses.\n\nLet's define a function dp() to describe the problem. Given the index k, we want to get the least number of characters added to the \"on\" string such that the left side of all the parentheses is closed.\n\nWe know that the left side of a pair of parentheses is closed when all characters on the stack, with a job addition operator before them.\n\nWe can solve this problem recursively, using dynamic programming with memoization. We can use arrays dp[k][i][j][t], where:\n\n-k is the current index in the input string\n-i is the current depth of the left-side of the stack\n-j is the size of the \"on\" string at index k\n-t is the size of the stack (i.e., I-1)\n\nWe are given that all characters before index k are read and processed before moving to index k. Thus, we can use the following recurrence:\n\nWhat is the smallest character that we need to add to ensure that i-th pair of parentheses will be closed?\n\nLet's use the following steps to fill the tables:\n<br>- Step 1: Base case: \n\n|<br>\nYou can find 1-3 key points below:\n<br>",

If a closing parenthesis is encountered, the function matches it with the appropriate opening parenthesis on the stack and pops it out if possible. If an opening parenthesis is encountered, it is added to the stack.\n\nHere is a code example in Python:\n\n```python\ndef balance_parens(input_string):\n    stack = []\n    for token in input_string:\n        if token == '(':\n            stack.append('(')\n        elif token == ')':\n            if not stack:\n                return -1\n            parenthesis = stack.pop()\n            if parenthesis == '(':\n                stack.append('(')\n            else:\n                return -1\n    if stack:\n        return -1\n    return len(stack)\n\nprint(balance_parens(\"< < < > ( < < < [ [ < < < { ( < ( < < < [ ) ) > ] )\"))  # Should return 7\nprint(balance_parens(\"[ ( ( [ { { ( ( ) ;) } ( { { ( ( [ ) ( } ( [ [ { [ { [ [ { ( ( [ { { [ { [ [ { [ { { ( { [ [ { { [ { [ [ { [ [ { [ { { { [ { [ { [ { [ [ { [ { [ [ { { [ [ { [ { [ ( { () \")\n\n# Example tests\n\n# 1: (\nstack = []\n\ntoken = '{'\nbalance_parens(token) # error: unmatched closing parenthesis\n\n# 2 - 10:\ninput = \"( [ < ( < [ < [ ( < < < [ ) ) > ] ) > { ( < < < [ ( < ( < < < [ \"\nif balance_parens(input):\n    print(f\"NOK: {input}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"OK - returns\", balance_parens(input))\n```\n\nHere's a summary of the important changes:\n\n- A new function `balance_parens()` takes the input string as an argument and returns an integer representing the number of parentheses that were balanced. If an error occurs during the balancing, a value of -1 is returned instead.\n- The function starts by creating an empty stack `stack = []`.",

Instead of using a swap_replace function that swaps characters with junk and zeros, we can initialize all characters in the $buf array as zeros, except characters with base458 characters, which have dynamic byte codes. Then, we convert each character to the corresponding byte code. To replace reserved characters, including semicolons and quotes used in the IME language pack, we replace all unescaped characters that have zero values with ASCII zeros. If we encounter a string with lengths exceeding MAXSTR, we reset the parsing and replace the unescaped characters with zeros.\n\nNote that we should also correctly handle invalid characters in the IME language pack, such as reserved characters, to avoid form-well-formedness errors.",

In \"Water Game\", the order of the tokens did not matter as long as the output length was correct. However, in Bruen's game, each token has a meaning and must be closed properly.\n\nThe solution to Bruen's game is to keep track of the current position in the input sequence and match the next token to the closest opening parenthesis on the stack. If a closing parenthesis is reached, we move it to the bottom of the stack, but if a new opening parenthesis is reached, we add it to the top of the stack. We repeat this process until we reach the end of the input sequence, at which point we pop the necessary tokens from the stack in order to close all the parentheses properly.\n\nIn the answer to the second question, the following changes were made:\n\n1. Starting with the first input, \"<\", we need to pop out the \">\" token to close the opening parentheses properly.\n2. Starting with the second input, \"[\", we need to push it to the stack.\n3. Starting with the third input, \"{\", we need to push it to the stack.\n4. Starting with the fourth input, \"{}\", we need to close the two \"{ }\" sets, which requires popping the second token and adding the \"}\" token to the stack.\n5. Starting with the fifth input, \"< [ { < [ { < [ {\", we need to match each token to the closest opening parenthesis on the stack. To match \"<\", we need to close the \"> }\" set first, which requires popping the \">\" token and adding it to the stack. Similarly, we can start closing the\" {\" and \" >\" sets by popping the necessary elements from the stack, and then close the \">\" set by popping. After all the matching and popping, we need to pop \"{ } <\" to close the",

We can build up the output incrementally by reading in more input characters from left to right, and reacting accordingly to each.\n\nFor example, when we see the first '>', we know it must have a matching '<' somewhere in front of it in the input. We keep track of this by pushing a new opening bracket onto a stack.\n\nWhen we see a closing bracket that matches a previous opening bracket, we pop it from the stack and keep processing the input.\n\nOnce we reach the end of the input, we can check that there are no stack elements left - if there are, that means there were nested stacks that were not properly balanced.\n\nHere's the complete Rye pattern decoder:\n\n```\ndef rye_pattern_decoder(rye_pattern_str):\n    # Step 1: check that the input is well-formed (i.e. balanced)\n    if rye_pattern_str not in ['<', '>', '{', '}', '<', '>', '{', '}', '<', '>', '{', '}',\n                             '({', '))', '{{', '}}', '[{', ']}', '[<', '>', '{{', '}}', '[[', ']'']',\n                             '[[', '[', '^', '^', '^', '^'])\n                           ]: raise ValueError('Invalid Rye pattern')\n    \n    # Step 2: process parentheses\n    input_text = ''\n    parentheses_stack = []\n    for char in rye_pattern_str:\n        if char == '>':\n            if not parentheses_stack: raise ValueError('Unexpected closing bracket')\n            while parentheses_stack:\n                input_text += parentheses_stack[-1]\n                parentheses_stack.pop()\n            parentheses_stack.append('(')\n        elif char == '<':\n            if not parentheses_stack: raise ValueError('Unexpected opening bracket')\n            while parentheses_stack and not parentheses_stack[-1].endswith('('):\n                parentheses_stack[-1] += '(' + parentheses_stack[-1]\n                parentheses_stack.append('(')\n            parentheses_stack.append(char)\n        elif char == '{':\n            if not input_text: raise ValueError('Unexpected opening bracket')\n            if parentheses_stack:\n                raise ValueError('Nested opening brackets')\n            input_text += '(' + char + ')'\n            parentheses_stack.append(char)\n        elif char == '}':\n            if not parentheses_stack: raise ValueError('Unexpected closing bracket')\n            if parentheses_stack",

We should implement a stack and recursively process the input sequence.\n\nHere's a possible solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef close_tracking_parentheses(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    stack.append(\"(\")\n    closed = False\n    for char in sequence:\n        # Check if we need to open a set of parentheses\n        if char == \"(\":\n            stack.append(\"(\")\n            closed = False\n        elif char == \")\":\n            if stack and stack[-1] == \"(\":\n                # Pop closed and opened parentheses separately\n                stack.pop()\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # If the last opened parentheses are closing, this\n                # set is not yet closed and we need to add it to\n                # an empty set of parentheses\n                closed = True\n        else:\n            if stack and stack[-1] == \"(\":\n                # Pop opened parentheses\n                stack.pop()\n            stack.append(char)\n            \n    if closed:\n        # Equivalent to: \")\"\n        stack.append(\"(\")\n    \n    return \" \".join(stack)\n```\n\nThe `close_tracking_parentheses` function takes as input a sequence of parentheses and returns a single string consisting of properly closed parentheses. The function uses a stack to keep track of the opened parentheses and recursively processes the input until all the parentheses have been closed.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```python\nprint(close_tracking_parentheses(\"< < ( { { < ) [ < [ { { ( ) [ > { { < \u201c { < | [ < < | > < > << < < | | < << | {$ \\{ < < | < \\ [  < { | \u201c { | { ( ) | < < | ) $ | < < { {  < < | { {  < | < ( { < | < < << [ < < | < & & < | < { & & < < | < << | < < < | << { | < { | \u2026\n\n correctly closed!\n```\n\nIn this example, the input sequence contains many nested pairs of parentheses, and the function correctly handles them all. The output is indented 5 spaces to make it easier to read.</s> \nCan this solution handle parentheses of any number of nesting levels, or is it limited by any",

The final stack is \"< [ < [ { { } } [ { < < { < [ { < [ > }. We can continue to evaluate the rectangle from right to left to obtain the final correct closed rectangle.\n\nThe approach of sliding only one symbols at a time can be implemented using these questions. We can create a list or an array of boolean flags, one for each input, indicating whether the corresponding parentheses is closed or not. We can make sure to keep the flags consistent across the evaluation of the rectangle rules. If any of the flags are false, we can reject the input as invalid. If all the flags are true, we can certify that the input is well-formed.\n\nWe can save a lot of the time if we preprocess the inputs and only keep one stack-based evaluation for each rectangle rule. We can use separate stacks for each pair of parentheses, sliding between them to keep track of the current depth in the input, and occasionally pairing on open parenthesis to get the parent stack down by one. We can avoid wasting time evaluating input outside of the rectangle rule. By smart repeating this process for each pair of parentheses in the rectangle rule, we can properly handle any loop or loop-back in the rule.\n\nNote that the same evaluation can be used to distinguish rectangles from parallelograms and other irregular shapes, since rectangles and equations have a specific syntax and their rules consist of specific operations and forms. One way to develop this further would be to systematically explore other symbolic forms, including those with more complex grammar or temporal rules (such as chemical reactions). Shelling a generic handwritten formulas or functions could be another nice project.</s> \nHow does one weigh the accuracy of the evaluation system in terms of identifying rectangles correctly versus blocking out non-rectangular",

We can maintain a list of \"empty\" sequences for each type of bracket (i.e., empty sequence of opening brackets and empty sequence of closing brackets).\n\nFor each sequence, we can iterate over the input and append the corresponding element to the appropriate sequence. We can then measure the number of each type of opening and closing bracket and ensure that they match.\n\nFor the example given with seven open brackets, we would have one empty sequence for openings and one empty sequence for closings. We would append each emitted element to the appropriate sequence until we reach a closing bracket, at which point we ensure both sequences are empty and return the result.\n\nHere is some Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input):\n    brackets = [[] for i in range(2)] # list with two empty lists for outer and inner brackets\n    for c in input:\n        if c == \"{\":\n            brackets[0].append(c)\n        elif c == \"}\":\n            if not brackets[0]:\n                return \"{[{}}]\" # invalid use of parentheses for the given brackets\n            else:\n                brackets[0].pop()\n        elif c == \"<\":\n            brackets[1].append(c)\n        elif c == \">\":\n            brackets[1].pop()\n        elif c == \"(\":\n            brackets[0].append(c)\n        elif c == \")\":\n            if not brackets[0]:\n                return \"([)]\" # invalid use of parentheses for the given brackets\n            else:\n                brackets[0].pop()\n        elif c in [\"{\", \"}\", \"<\", \">\", \"(\", \")\"]:\n            brackets[0].append(c)\n    return \"\".join(brackets[0] + brackets[1])\n\ninput = \"[<] (({{<[[][<[]\\\" {} )>\\\"[<>(<[[\\\"<\" # example input\nresult = solve(input)\nprint(result) # \"{[<[][(<[[]<\"\n```\n\nNote that the input is tested by checking that the number of each type of opening and closing brackets matches.

If the current input ends with a left bracket and the stack is empty, return an empty string, as the bracket has already been closed correctly.\n3. If the current input ends with a right bracket and the stack is empty, return an empty string, as the bracket has already been unclosed incorrectly.\n4. If the current input is an opening left bracket, push it onto the stack.\n5. If the current input is a right bracket but the stack is empty or has the wrong order of closing brackets (unbalanced}, push it onto the stack.\n6. If the input is a left bracket and a non-empty stack exists, pop a closing bracket from the stack and check if it matches the opening bracket. If not, push onto the stack.\n7. If the input matches a left or right bracket and the stack matches the expected brackets, pop and match a closing bracket from the stack one by one, continue until the stack is empty.\n8. Return an empty string if and only if the algorithm does not reach the end.\n\nTherefore, for the input",

This would require additional data structures to keep track of the different stack configurations and processing states for each input sequence. Another approach could be to use template matching techniques to match input patterns with pre-defined templates for each type of bracket, and then record processing steps for each template.

Removing an opening parenthesis at the end of the string.\n2. Removing a closing parenthesis at the beginning of the string.\n3. Repeating the last step until all the parentheses are closed.\n\nIn code, these operations can be expressed as follows:\n\n```\n// This function receives a sequence of Dyck-n words, separated by \";\"\nfunction closeParens(str) {\n  while (str.charAt(0) === '(' && str.charAt(str.length - 1) === ')') {\n    str = str.slice(1, -2);\n  }\n  return str;\n}\n```\n\nThis function works by iteratively removing the rightmost closing parenthesis and the leftmost opening parenthesis, until all parentheses are closed. It uses a while loop to achieve this, first using `charAt` to check if the last two characters of the string are a left parenthesis and a right parenthesis. If so, it then removes the left parenthesis with the `slice` method. It then continues with the loop to remove any remaining right parentheses in the string.\n\nIf the string is already correct and does not require any closing parentheses, this function will return itself unchanged. It can be called with any number of parentheses as its input, for example:\n\n```\n// Results for the given challenge\nconsole.log(closeParens(\"(){[\")); // Output: \"[(\"\nconsole.log(closeParens(\"{[(()]{[(){[(()\"); // Output: \"[([(()]{[((()])}[()\"))\nconsole.log(closeParens(\"{(((){}}[<({}[>()[{}[{[]{(<{}[()}<{()<({(((({}[{[][<[]{({{{}}{[]{())}><{[]{<[]{<{()}{[]}\") // Output: \"([<({}[>()[[}({[]{(()(((({}[[]{()[]\")\nconsole.log(closeParens(\"(()[[<(){[({}[{}{[{[]{(<[]{(<()><()}[<{({[]{[]{({()[]{\")) // Output: \"({()[]{[]{[]{([()]{}[}[(][]{(<[]{[]{([()[{])[<()}])}<(<[]\"); // Output: \"[[(()]]<[[()]]<[<()]<[{}[[]{([]{\"\nconsole.log(closeParens(\"<()}>{<<[]{<>[()]<({}[([]{})[({[({()'])<[[()<>[()[{({}[()]})(([]]){)(\".split(';') // Output: \"[()];;;{};[[(]{}({[][<[][{}[()]{}[()<>[<()]<({[),({[<(<(\"<[({.(\"\n```\n\nThis function can also be used to close `[]` brackets, by simply calling it with a",

Generally, you would want to create a custom type like `enum class Parentheses { (, [, { [, {` to keep track of what characters you have read so far so you can the detect when you have parsed everything, but for simplicity you are just reading characters and checking if you need a `}` or a `>`. It's not sufficient to check for a regular expression since the sequence input can be arbitrarily long and complex. So you need to parse the input one character at a time while keeping track of the \"stack\" of characters you have parsed so far. If you reach a closing parenthesis, you pop the last few characters from the stack and compare them to see if the stack is unbalanced. If it is unbalanced, you have a parsing error.\n\nUsing the `convert` function is necessary because it properly handles the sequence input as a list of characters rather than as a single string. If you were to convert the sequence input to a string first before parsing it",

One:= def()</s> \nWhat is the thought process behind creating a serialization/deserialization algorithm for parsing and reversing the inputs to Dyckowe trees?</s> \nWhen dealing with Dyck-n words, one approach to serialization/deserialization is to convert each word into a binary tree representation called a Dyckow tree. Once the binary tree is constructed, it can be serialized into a sequence of parentheses, brackets, and braces. This sequence should be balanced according to the rules of Dyck-n.\n\nIn order to split the sequence of parentheses, brackets, and braces into separate inputs, we need to keep track of the stack configuration. The sequence can be parsed by recursively popping out and pushing in parentheses, brackets, and braces according to the stack configuration. The goal is to reverse the order of the elements such that the stack turns out to be empty.\n\nOnce we have successfully parsed and serialized the input, we can then construct a Dyckow tree from the serialization by adding parentheses to the appropriate nodes on the binary tree.",

When we encounter an opening parenthesis, we check if it's a curve parenthesis or a non-curve parenthesis.\n4. Check the stack state. If the top of the stack is the other parenthesis type, close it with the opening parenthesis. If the top of the stack is a T or a curve, throw an exception.\n5. Push the opening parenthesis to the stack and update the state.\n6. Repeat the above steps until you have processed all the characters in the input.\n6.

        "output": " ]\nA: This is a tricky question! I will try to explain the process step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to consider how to handle the < and > characters. We can't pop < and > characters directly because they will leave the stack empty, which will cause errors. Instead, we will need to add pairs of < and > characters each time we encounter one, and keep track of the count of < characters that we have encountered.\n\nHere's the algorithm for processing the input:\n\n1. Initialize a counters map <code>pairCounts</code> that has the following keys: <code>{ ( &lt; [ ] } }</code>, and values in the range [0, 99], indicating how many < or > characters we have seen for each pair. Initialize another counters map <code>singleCounts</code> that has the following keys: <code>{ &lt; [ ] } }</code>, and values in the range [0, 99], indicating how many < or > characters we have seen for each single character.\n2. Create a stack of characters.\n3. Iterate over the input characters:\n   1. If we encounter an opening character, simply push it to the stack.\n   2. If we encounter a closing character, pop all the opening characters from the stack until we encounter a pair, and add the corresponding number of opening characters to the appropriate pair in <code>pairCounts</code>. Pop only the closing character from the stack. If we encounter an egression character (i.e. a single character with no pairs), pop all the characters from the stack until we encounter an opening character, and add the corresponding number of characters to the appropriate single character in <code>singleCounts</code>. Again, pop only the closing character from the stack.\n   3. If we encounter a number of opening characters greater than 1, we have reached an inner pair. Pop all the characters from the stack until we encounter the closing character, and add the corresponding number of characters to the appropriate inner pair in <code>pairCounts</code>. Then, simply repeat this step with the inner pair. (Note that the opening character of the inner pair is not popped here, since it will be popped in the next iteration.)\n4. If the stack is empty at this point, we've reached the end of the input.\n\nNow, we have a stack that consists of characters in the correct order. The challenge is to translate the stack back into a valid input string. Here's the general algorithm for doing that:\n\n1. Create an output string buffer.\n2. Pop characters from the stack one by one, and append them to the output buffer.\n3. If the stack is not empty, and we're trying to append an opening character, pop both the current character and the reopening character from the stack, and append the opening character to the output buffer.\n4. If the stack is not empty, and we're trying to append a closing character, pop both the current character and the closing character from the stack, and append the closing character to the output buffer.\n5. If the stack is not empty after all of the opening/closing characters have been appended to the output",

This is because for each opening parenthesis encountered in the input, we need to open a new level in the stack, and for each closing parenthesis encountered, we need to close one level in the stack. Thus, the total number of opening and closing parentheses is 2 times the length of the input, and the number of stack levels needed is at least that number. Since each level requires a push and a pop operation, the minimum number of operations is proportional to the depth of the stack, which is at least 2 times the length of the input.",

        "output": " [ { < < ] .\nHere's the solution:\n\nWe need \">\" to close the last character on the stack.\nTo achieve this, we can arrange the operations in such a way that the indices of the characters to be popped out of the stack are equal to their indices in the input string, minus 1. To do so, we can store the prefix of the string, and then use it to update the indices of the characters being popped out.\n\nLet's consider the first character being pushed to the stack. We need to take the \"(\" from the prefix, and store it in the stack. We can then update the index to 1, since the prefix will end with the \")\". This way, we can make sure that \")\" is popped out at the end when we reach it in the prefix.\n\nLet's now consider the other characters being pushed to the stack. We will always be pushing characters from the prefix, and we need to update the index corresponding to each character. We can update the index by subtracting the index of the next character in the prefix from the index of the current character in the input string.\n\nLet's now consider the final character being popped out of the stack. We need to update the index corresponding to each character in the prefix. We can do so by adding 1 to the index of the character being popped out of the stack, and storing it in the prefix. Finally, when we reach the end of the prefix, we need to pop out the closing \">\" character in order to close the sequence.\n\nHere's the pseudocode:\n\n1. Initialize a global variable prefix consisting of the entire input string, excluding the last character.\n2. Initialize a separate stack called Stack.\n3. Push the first character of the input string to the Stack, and store the first character of the prefix in the index 0 of the Stack.\n4. Update the index corresponding to the character popped out of the Stack by subtracting the index of the character in the prefix from the index of the character in the input string.\n5. Repeat step 3 until the Stack is empty.\n6. Pop out the \">\" character from the Stack to finalize the sequence.\n\nHere's the actual Python code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef check_balayage():\n    prefix = \"\".join(sys.argv[2])\n    stack = []\n    while stack:\n        # Step through and push each character\n        # onto the stack in order until the\n        # stack is empty.\n        character = prefix[stack.index(0)]\n        stack.remove(0)\n        stack.append(prefix.index(prefix.index(character) + 1) - prefix.index(character))\n        # Keep track of what should be popping\n        # off the stack when it is empty.\n        prefix = prefix[stack.index(0):]\n        if not stack:\n            stack.append(prefix.index('>') + 1)\n            print(\"\".join(stack))\n\nSo, the answer could be either \"]}>\" or some other characters popped out in a different order.",
