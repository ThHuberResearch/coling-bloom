Let's go from left:\nAmul n \nConsider writing -4+5 which equals 5 and ask which one to do first. First, we notice that 5 and -4 equal 9. Also, in the parenthesis, mixing with the multiplication operation means that they are being added as well.\nNow consider A = (-6 + -9 - -6 + -4).\nAgain, we see A and -6 are -6, so we can add them together directly, leaving us with -6+4=2.\nNow, we add 2 + 4 which equals 6.\nLast, we do multiplication first, so A = (6*1) = 6.\nNow onto B, we do A + B, so B = -6 + 4.\nThen, we do this multiplication first, so B +-4 = -6.\nThen, we add (-6) to -6, which equals 58.\nNow, A + B = -6 + (58) = 1938.\n((-8 * 6 + -16) * (-1 - 8 + 7) * dad)\nA: Let\u2019s plug in numbers for convenience.

So, we can write (9*7*7^2 - 9*7*7 + -9 + 9*7*7^20 - 9*7*7 + -9)/7 as B, where B is the constant term, since the multiplication of a and n equals the integer value of n. Then, we can interpret n=9*5*7^2 + 9*7*7 as x^2, which is equal to -910*7, so we multiply the refent sum by (9*7) and then take the multiplication that doesn't exceed B. This is (9*7^13 - 9*7^12)/7, which is equal to (9*7)^8, which we can interpret as x^2.

For example:\n\n1000\n1 x 2 = 2\n10 x 100 = 10000\n100 x 10 = 1,000.\n100 x 100 = 10,000\n\nHere's an example:\n\nA job shops have 40 employees who earn $6.50/hour. A lot of the shops have two employees who earn a $50.00/hour. They now need to figure out if the two people are the only ones that earn a higher rate than the other employees. Let's simplify their incomes:\n\nA1 = .8 * (10000 * 6.5)\nA2 = (5 * 50 + 100= 15000 + (50 * $100 = $50000))\n\nA1 is $42.50, so this means that the two people earn a rate of $95.00 - ($42.48) = $42.51 per hour from the shop. This is a more specific outcome, as the representation is near the level of the basic multiplication. So, there are only two employees of the shop that are earning more than their regular rate. The answer is that they are the only two employees that aren't earning a salary less than basic multiplication (62.5 x $6.50).\n\nquantaize the answer\nPunch Plane-DIA Series-Mini\nName: | Distance | Scale {1 : }\n---- | -------- | ------\nP6 | 68KM in 249 miles | 1",

        "output": "\nA: Let\u2019s take a closer look at the equation and just one expression at time. Remember that we are dealing with two variables (8 and -8), so any equation or expression involving them must have the sign of one of the variables in each term.\nLet\u2019s start with \u201c-8 + 5 - 0 - 6\u201d. Here, we\u2019re dealing with variables that are different. If we imagine that -8 and 5 and -8 are two constants, then the equation would be 1 + 0 = 0. However, we can\u2019t have a 0 and a 1 in the same expression.\nNext, we have \u201c-8 + 5 - 0 - 6\u201d. Variables get added based on multiplication, so in this case, -8 and 5 times -0 would equal (-8) while 8 times -0 would equal 0. Does that make sense?\nBefore we add any more terms, let\u2019s look at \u201cA*B*C*D\u201d. The law of multiplication is applied here. Multiply 11/7 and 3/6: 11/7 = (-175)/7 = (-27)/7 = -9. So, multiple -9 times 3/6 can be done by multiplying them one at a time. Therefore, 9/6 or 1/6 = 3/36 which equals -126. Terminating down, 2/6 equals -10.\nBased on the -10 result, you add a -10 to -9 times 6 = -54 more terms to \u201c-8 + 5 - 0 - 6. Many times this method requires being so specific that it takes more \u201cchips\u201d than can be developed.\nSo sumizing all this, we could say that (-8 + 5 - 0 - 6) depends on the sign of the 8. If 8 had a + sign and the number was 8*5 - 0 or less, then it\u2019s a sum of -56 sum of 6*5 or less. That works too if 8 wasn\u2019t -8.\nLooking at the equations, we are still dealing with one set of variables (-8 and -24) which have different signs. If we consider them to be constant (+8 = 8 or -8 = -8) then for the first part the equation is easy as it would be 0*8 = -64 which equals -384. And for the other part it is -24*(-8) = -7 which you then multiply (-14) to get 7. So our answer is -384. for (+8 = 8) or (-8 = -8), both terms will have double negative signs so the equation could be seen as (7 = -8 or (-8 = -8) and they cancel out each other).\nSimilarly in each case given -8 and -240.\nQ: ((-8 + 5 - 0 - 6) * (-5 * -4 - 6 + -3)) * -\\(11 * 7 * 3.5))\nA: Let the equation be (-8 + 5 - 0 - 6).

So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate: (4 - 8 - -9) ^ X = 4 - 8 - (4*9) = 36.\nTherefore, we are to the power of 7. So to the power of 7, the answer is our original number - 44282.\n\nLet\u2019s change it a bit. Let\u2019s multiply 3 (this time inside parentheses) for our second problem. First we see that we have variables and not exponents.\nLet\u2019s calculate first:\nDo {multiply exponents}\n= (((i * 4 * 5) * (1)) - (i * 1))/5.\nSo, it would be i*13. So, what we want to know is (13 / (?)), which is our original number. Then elevate the parentheses.\nSo far, we only have an exponent after the 2nd problem. We\u2019ve already been down this road and we\u2019re supposed to add or subtract exponents to get through the entire problem.\nBut, just because we know we have an exponent, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going that route. The \u00abtry to simplify\u00bb conversion rule.\nAs a result, we need to multiply variables. Therefore, we should use rearranging notation. Now where is the answer written, after adding, that question is: 4*8*a*(4*a - 4) = 4*12*4-4.*4*11 = 38483, and that\u2019s the$. So this is 84483.\nAlso, there are a pair of questions that are no place problems. A and B multiplied because they are terms. As terms, a and b are just variables. Their inequality can be resolved in either order. This step depends on how you solved the problem.\nSo assuming you worked on solving the first problems from XP onwards like this (4 + 8 - (4 x p(20 - 1)) ^ 7 - 211 just worked) - 52 + a * 4 ^ 3 ^ 2 = 48747. So let's go with the rearranging notation for this. Therefore, our original number is (i * 4 * a * 12 * 101) ^ 19 with a after 4 to get 57883. Thus, we complete the formula for the result: A-B = (4*7-4) == than just 72491. Answer - The Simpsons!

Let's apply that to the equation given.\nLet's take the terms inside the parentheses first. Within the parentheses, the first term is (-5 * 8), which is -40. After that, we have 5 * -2, which is -10. So the summary of the section 1 is -(5 + 10) = -15.\nLet's take the terms outside the parentheses next. We add (-5) to 10, which is -15.\nThen, we take a special case of times and multiply with the result and add -1. Within parentheses, the term 10 ^ 2 is 25. Therefore the conclusion of the section is (-353 + 25 = 210).\nFinally, let's take the rest of the terms, which are inside the logarithm notation of -763. Here is the granularity of the result. The logarithm of -763 is 4.\nTherefore, the solution is -763.\nQuestion: 8^222236551303+28&-5433367793000\na -b\n-38\nI find it easier to use multiverse theory, which has no imagination when it comes to the side effects of various possible multiple universes.\nSince you are minimizing the number of words needed to represent -196 genes by placing separate characters in a separate row, the number of bits of -196 = 6x64 = 86547.

Similarly, if \"b\" is a relatively large number, it may also pose difficulties in the processing of the information for the equation.\n\nIn general, the larger the numbers being used in the equation, the more calculations and processing power will be required to perform the necessary calculations.

Let's calculate the middle row, starting at index -1. The equation uses two different variables back to back. We will calculate the right-most variable first, leave out the left one.\nLet's eliminate the left variable first. In this case, the left variable can be what's left over after subtracting 4 digits from the right-hand side of 5287. We see that 11568 - 2711 = 7347.

Then we can combine the results using the order of operations, which is to do the multiplication and division first. Repeating the rule of least common denominator, we first combine the set of parentheses involving 4 and 7: (4 * -7 = +9). Then we can do the multiplication: 4 * -9 = -? Because we need to handle the -9 separately, since we want the first number in the parentheses to be the least common denominator of 7. We handle the -9 by doing 3 * -18, which equals +6, and simplifies to +9. Then we do the division: 4 - (-9) = +1. Together, the equation becomes (1 + 1) - (6 = 1). \n\nWhen combining the results of the first set of parentheses, we first multiply and then divide before finally adding and subtracting. Therefore,: (1 + 1) + 4 - (-6) = 2 + 8 - (-4). This results in 2 + (8 + 8) - (-4 = 8 = 8 - 4). \n\nWhen we combine the second set of parentheses, we first multiply: (4 - (Q * 4)).

So, we have: (9 - (-6) * -8) = (9 - (-6 * -8) = -(-6 * 8). \n\nThe set of \u2013s are being raised to the same power of the parentheses, so:\n\n- -9 * (8 * -8) = -(-63) = 186. \n\nWhen substituting this into calc1 and calc2 we get:\n\n- (9 + (-9) * (8 * -8) = -39, which is the answer.\n\nSo the final equation is ((9 + (-9) * (8 * -8) = -39). \n\nA: Let's see if we can simplify this equation. \n\nFirst, we'll do the exponent: 4 * (-9 = 39).

Since 4 * (23 * 7.5 * -8 = 630), let's calculate (13 + 5 - 6)(630) = 41950 for n and x to answer for 'n', 13 + 5 - 6 x (95.25 * -8 = -180.25 * -8 = -16025) = 41686. \n\nTherefore, the final result is 41686 * (620-20) = 41950 * 62150 = 97983500.",
