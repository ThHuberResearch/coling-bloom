An additional objective is to introduce students to the branch of critical legal studies known as 'law and literature', which can be broken down into three components:(i) the ideology of law and legal practice as a means of both legitimizing and critiquing contemporary legal culture(ii) the discursive nature of representations of law and lawyers within the wider community that govern the social perceptions of legal practice and dispute resolution(iii) the social function of the cultural representation of law, which operates to reconcile the community to orthodox legal practice through the creation and circulation of a set of stereotypes and collective expectations concerning legal standards and outcomes.",Apply
"Employing both academic (secondary) and non-academic (primary) texts, the unit will consider a number of important facets of critical legal scholarship, most importantly the 'law and literature' movement, which tries to both explain and critique law in terms of the various literary techniques of dramatic narrative. This unit largely operates within the 'law and literature' tradition by directly engaging with novels and films, both of which are highly narrative-driven artistic forms. The text's depiction and resolution of the legal issue under its consideration will be discussed in class as a parallel, or secondary, commentary on the centrality of narrative to all forms of legal speech and practice.",Understand
