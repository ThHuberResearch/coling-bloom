The classes and their description are provided below:\nMetacognitive: Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one's own cognition.\n\nProcedural: How to do something, methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, and methods.\n\nConceptual: The interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function together.\n\nFactual: The basic elements students must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it.\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\nTim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?\nClassification:\n"]]
