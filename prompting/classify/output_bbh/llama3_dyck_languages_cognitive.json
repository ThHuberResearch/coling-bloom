The classes and their description are provided below:\nRemember: Recall facts and basic concepts.\n[Examples]: define, duplicate, list, memorize, repeat, state\n\nUnderstand: Explain ideas or concepts.\n[Examples]: classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognize, report, select, translate\n\nApply: Use information in new situations.\n[Examples]: execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch\n\nAnalyze: Draw connections among ideas.\n[Examples]: differentiate, organize, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test\n\nEvaluate: Justify a stand or decision.\n[Examples]: appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, weigh\n\nCreate: Produce new or original work.\n[Examples]: design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, investigate<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\nComplete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: [ < < > > < ( < < < [ [ [ [ ] ] ] ] > > > ) [ < < [ ] > > ] { [ < > ] < > [ ( ) ] } { [ ]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nClassification:\n"]]
