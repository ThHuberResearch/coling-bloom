This requires identifying the relationships between the statements, making inferences, and evaluating the truthfulness of each statement to arrive at a conclusion. This is a classic example of analyzing and making connections among ideas, which fits the description of the Analyze category in Bloom's taxonomy.", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYour task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy.
