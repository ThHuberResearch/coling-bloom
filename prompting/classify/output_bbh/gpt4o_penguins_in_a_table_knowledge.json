The classes and their description are provided below:\nMetacognitive: Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one's own cognition.\n\nProcedural: How to do something, methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, and methods.\n\nConceptual: The interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function together.\n\nFactual: The basic elements students must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it.\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\nHere is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:\nJames, 12, 90, 12\nWhat is the average height of the penguins?\nOptions:\n(A) 60\n(B) 65\n(C) 70\n(D) 75\n(E) 80\nClassification:\n"], ["The problem presented involves examining a table to find and interpret specific pieces of basic information about the penguins, such as their names, ages, heights, and weights. It then asks the user to deduce the youngest penguin after deleting one of the entries. This task requires a basic understanding of reading and extracting factual information from a table.\n\nClassification: **Factual**", "Your task is to classify tasks into the Knowledge dimension of Bloom's taxonomy.
