He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad.

The task does not involve applying knowledge to a new situation but making a judgment based on a given scenario.\n\n4. **Analyze:**\n   This involves drawing connections among ideas, such as comparing, contrasting, or differentiating. The task involves a higher level of judgment and evaluation rather than just analyzing connections.\n\n5. **Evaluate:**\n   This involves justifying a stand or decision.

He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered.
