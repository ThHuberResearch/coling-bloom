The classes and their description are provided below:\nRemember: Recall facts and basic concepts.\n[Examples]: define, duplicate, list, memorize, repeat, state\n\nUnderstand: Explain ideas or concepts.\n[Examples]: classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognize, report, select, translate\n\nApply: Use information in new situations.\n[Examples]: execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch\n\nAnalyze: Draw connections among ideas.\n[Examples]: differentiate, organize, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test\n\nEvaluate: Justify a stand or decision.\n[Examples]: appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, weigh\n\nCreate: Produce new or original work.\n[Examples]: design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, investigate\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\nComplete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.

This task requires the application of logical and analytical skills to manipulate the given sequence and ensure its correctness.\n\nBased on the Bloom's taxonomy, the appropriate classification for this problem would be:\n\nAnalyze: Draw connections among ideas.\n\nThe reason for this classification is that the problem requires the learner to examine the given sequence, differentiate the different types of brackets and parentheses, and organize the remaining elements to create a logically consistent and properly balanced sequence. This process involves analyzing the relationships between the various components of the sequence and drawing connections to arrive at the correct solution.\n\nThe task does not simply involve recalling or understanding information (Remember and Understand categories), nor does it involve applying a known solution in a new situation (Apply category). It also does not require evaluating or justifying a decision (Evaluate category) or creating a new or original work (Create category).\n\nTherefore, the appropriate classification for this problem is Analyze, as it aligns with the requirements of drawing connections among the ideas and elements of the given sequence.", "Your task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy.
