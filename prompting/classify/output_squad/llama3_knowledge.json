Scholars within China also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of suzerainty, that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it simply paid tribute until the Jiajing Emperor (1521\u20131566), who ceased relations with Tibet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nClassification:\n"], ["Factual \n\nReasoning: The task requires the student to recall a specific piece of information, which is a basic element in the domain of knowledge.
