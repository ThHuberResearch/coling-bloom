The concept of complex numbers and the operations involved in multiplying complex numbers.\n\nThe problem requires the student to apply their understanding of these conceptual relationships to compute the numerical value of the given product. It goes beyond simply recalling factual information or following a specific procedure, and instead focuses on the student's ability to grasp the underlying concepts and apply them to solve the problem.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be classified as a Conceptual task within the Knowledge dimension of Bloom's Taxonomy.", "Your task is to classify tasks into the Knowledge dimension of Bloom's taxonomy. The classes and their description are provided below:\nMetacognitive: Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one's own cognition.\n\nProcedural: How to do something, methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, and methods.\n\nConceptual: The interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function together.\n\nFactual: The basic elements students must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it.\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\nRegular decagon $P_1 P_2 \\dotsb P_{10}$ is drawn in the coordinate plane with $P_1$ at $(1,0)$ and $P_6$ at $(3,0).$  If $P_n$ is the point $(x_n,y_n),$ compute the numerical value of the product\n\\[(x_1 + y_1 i)(x_2 + y_2 i)(x_3 + y_3 i) \\dotsm (x_{10} + y_{10} i).\\]\nClassification:\n"]]
