The approach to solving the problem requires using knowledge of complex numbers, properties of regular polygons, and potentially trigonometric identities and geometry.\n\nLet's break down the required steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify vertices of the regular decagon**: This requires understanding the geometry of a regular decagon, which divides the circle into 10 equal parts.\n2. **Convert vertices to complex numbers**: Each vertex \\( P_k \\) at coordinates \\((x_k, y_k) \\) can be translated into a complex number \\( x_k + y_k i \\).\n3. **Leverage properties of roots of unity**: Recognizing that the vertices of the regular decagon can be represented as 10th roots of unity on the complex plane, scaled and translated appropriately.\n4. **Calculate the product of these complex numbers**: Using properties of roots of unity and considering symmetries for simplification.\n\nGiven these steps, the task of calculating this product fits well under the category \"Apply\" in Bloom's taxonomy because it involves using geometric properties and complex numbers to find a solution to the new situation posed by the problem.\n\n### Classification:\n**Apply**", "Your task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy.
