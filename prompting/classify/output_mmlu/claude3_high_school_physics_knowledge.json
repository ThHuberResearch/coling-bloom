The classes and their description are provided below:\nMetacognitive: Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one's own cognition.\n\nProcedural: How to do something, methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, and methods.\n\nConceptual: The interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function together.\n\nFactual: The basic elements students must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it.\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\nIn a certain region, the electric field varies with the radius away from origin by the equation Er = \u20136r^2 + 4r + 3, where r is given in meters and E in N/C. The potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4) is\nClassification:\n"]]
