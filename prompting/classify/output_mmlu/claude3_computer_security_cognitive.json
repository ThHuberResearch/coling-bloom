To prevent SQL injection, one needs to analyze the problem, understand the underlying concepts, and draw connections between the techniques used to mitigate this security issue.\n\nThe \"Analyze\" category in Bloom's taxonomy involves the ability to examine and break down information into parts, identify patterns and relationships, and draw conclusions. In the context of preventing SQL injection, this would involve analyzing the different methods and techniques that can be used to secure SQL queries, such as:\n\n1. Input validation and sanitization: Examining how to properly validate and sanitize user input to prevent it from being interpreted as part of the SQL query.\n2. Parameterized queries: Understanding the concept of using parameterized queries and prepared statements to separate the SQL logic from the user input.\n3. Principle of least privilege: Analyzing the importance of granting the minimum required privileges to database users to limit the potential damage of a successful SQL injection attack.\n4. Defense-in-depth: Examining multiple layers of security controls, such as web application firewalls, to provide additional protection against SQL injection attacks.\n\nBy analyzing these different techniques and their effectiveness in preventing SQL injection, the problem can be classified under the \"Analyze\" category of Bloom's taxonomy.", "Your task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy.

This requires understanding the concept of stealthiness in the context of penetration testing, which involves explaining the idea or concept of being stealthy.\n\nThe task does not involve simply recalling facts or basic concepts (Remember), using information in a new situation (Apply), drawing connections among ideas (Analyze), justifying a stand or decision (Evaluate), or producing new or original work (Create). Instead, it focuses on explaining and understanding the meaning of being stealthy during a penetration test, which aligns with the \"Understand\" category of Bloom's taxonomy.", "Your task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy.
