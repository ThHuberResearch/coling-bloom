In this case, the problem involves understanding the logical relationship between the concepts of \"artifacts\" and \"people\" and translating it into predicate logic.\n\nSelecting the best translation into predicate logic requires an understanding of the conceptual framework of predicate logic and the ability to map the relationship between the given concepts into the appropriate logical representation. This goes beyond simply recalling factual information (Factual knowledge) or procedural steps (Procedural knowledge), and involves understanding the underlying conceptual structure and how the elements interact (Conceptual knowledge).\n\nTherefore, the classification of the given problem would be Conceptual knowledge within the Knowledge dimension of Bloom's taxonomy.", "Your task is to classify tasks into the Knowledge dimension of Bloom's taxonomy. The classes and their description are provided below:\nMetacognitive: Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one's own cognition.\n\nProcedural: How to do something, methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, and methods.\n\nConceptual: The interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function together.\n\nFactual: The basic elements students must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it.\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\n Select the best translation into predicate logic: No artifacts are people.\nClassification:\n"]]
