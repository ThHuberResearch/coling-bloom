This requires the ability to analyze the information provided, make comparisons, and draw conclusions about the potential causes of the observed wavelength shift.\n\nThe key steps involved in this problem are:\n\n1. Identify the relevant information: The laboratory measurement shows the hydrogen spectral line at 486.1 nm, while the same line in the star's spectrum appears at 485.9 nm.\n\n2. Analyze the difference in wavelength: The observed difference in wavelength between the laboratory measurement and the star's spectrum is 0.2 nm.\n\n3. Draw a connection to the underlying physical phenomenon: The change in wavelength of the spectral line is likely due to the Doppler effect, which is caused by the motion of the star relative to the observer. This can be used to infer the radial velocity of the star.\n\n4. Interpret the findings: Based on the observed wavelength shift, the problem requires the solver to conclude that the star is moving relative to the observer, and the direction of motion can be determined (whether the star is moving towards or away from the observer).\n\nBy engaging in these analytical steps, the solver is demonstrating the ability to draw connections among the given information, make comparisons, and arrive at a conclusion about the underlying physical process. This aligns with the \"Analyze\" category of Bloom's taxonomy.", "Your task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy.
