It simply asks the user to identify which one of the given statements is true, which involves recalling or recognizing the correct information.\n\nThe \"Remember\" category in Bloom's taxonomy is characterized by tasks that involve recognizing, recalling, or remembering facts, concepts, or information.

In this case, the problem requires the student to calculate the Larmor frequency, which involves applying the formula for Larmor frequency, which is a fundamental concept in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nThe problem does not simply require the recall of facts (Remember) or the explanation of the concept of Larmor frequency (Understand). Rather, it asks the student to use the formula and apply it to a specific magnetic field value to calculate the Larmor frequency, which is a step beyond just understanding the concept.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate classification for this problem is \"Apply\" in Bloom's taxonomy.", "Your task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy.
