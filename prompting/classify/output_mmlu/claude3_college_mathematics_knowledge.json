Assuming that the sequence converges and finding the limit of the sequence.\n\nThese steps require an understanding of the conceptual relationships between the elements of the sequence, the properties of the square root function, and the concept of sequence convergence. The problem does not involve the recall of specific facts (Factual knowledge) or the application of a specific procedure or algorithm (Procedural knowledge). It also does not require metacognitive knowledge, which involves the awareness and regulation of one's own thinking processes.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate classification of this problem is the Conceptual knowledge dimension of Bloom's taxonomy.", "Your task is to classify tasks into the Knowledge dimension of Bloom's taxonomy. The classes and their description are provided below:\nMetacognitive: Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one's own cognition.\n\nProcedural: How to do something, methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, and methods.\n\nConceptual: The interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function together.\n\nFactual: The basic elements students must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it.\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\nLet x_1 = 1 and x_(n+1) = sqrt(3+2x_n) for all positive integers n. If it is assumed that {x_n} converges, then lim x_n =\nClassification:\n"]]
