It is also not primarily about the conceptual understanding of the relationships between the elements of a recursive procedure. Finally, it does not involve metacognitive knowledge about one's own cognition or the general principles of cognition.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate classification of this problem is Procedural, as it is asking about the methods and techniques related to the implementation and behavior of recursive procedures.", "Your task is to classify tasks into the Knowledge dimension of Bloom's taxonomy. The classes and their description are provided below:\nMetacognitive: Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one's own cognition.\n\nProcedural: How to do something, methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, and methods.\n\nConceptual: The interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function together.\n\nFactual: The basic elements students must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it.\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\nLet P be a procedure that for some inputs calls itself (i.e., is recursive). If P is guaranteed to terminate, which of the following statements must be true?\nI. P has a local variable.\nII. P has an execution path where it does not call itself.\nIII. P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.\nClassification:\n"]]
