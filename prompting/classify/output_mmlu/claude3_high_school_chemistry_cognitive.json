The classes and their description are provided below:\nRemember: Recall facts and basic concepts.\n[Examples]: define, duplicate, list, memorize, repeat, state\n\nUnderstand: Explain ideas or concepts.\n[Examples]: classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognize, report, select, translate\n\nApply: Use information in new situations.\n[Examples]: execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch\n\nAnalyze: Draw connections among ideas.\n[Examples]: differentiate, organize, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test\n\nEvaluate: Justify a stand or decision.\n[Examples]: appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, weigh\n\nCreate: Produce new or original work.\n[Examples]: design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, investigate\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\nA mechanism is a sequence of elementary reactions that add up to the overall reaction stoichiometry. A substance that is produced in one elementary reaction and consumed in another is called\nClassification:\n"], ["The given problem can be classified into the \"Apply\" category of Bloom's taxonomy.\n\nThe problem requires the use of the concept of radioactive half-life to calculate the number of half-lives needed to reduce a given amount of a radioactive substance to a smaller amount. This involves applying the knowledge of radioactive half-life in a new situation to solve the problem.\n\nThe key verbs that indicate the \"Apply\" category in Bloom's taxonomy are \"use,\" \"demonstrate,\" and \"interpret,\" which are applicable to this problem.\n\nTherefore, the classification of the given problem is \"Apply\" in Bloom's taxonomy.", "Your task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy.
