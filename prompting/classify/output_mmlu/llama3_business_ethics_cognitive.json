It's not simply recalling a fact or concept, but rather making a value judgment about its effectiveness in the context of the 2008 recession. This requires evaluating the model's performance and making a decision about its relative merit, which falls under the \"Evaluate\" category of Bloom's taxonomy.", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYour task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy. The classes and their description are provided below:\nRemember: Recall facts and basic concepts.\n[Examples]: define, duplicate, list, memorize, repeat, state\n\nUnderstand: Explain ideas or concepts.\n[Examples]: classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognize, report, select, translate\n\nApply: Use information in new situations.\n[Examples]: execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch\n\nAnalyze: Draw connections among ideas.\n[Examples]: differentiate, organize, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test\n\nEvaluate: Justify a stand or decision.\n[Examples]: appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, weigh\n\nCreate: Produce new or original work.\n[Examples]: design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, investigate<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\nThe Anglo-American model being considered the best model in light of the recession in the late 2000s.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nClassification:\n"]]
