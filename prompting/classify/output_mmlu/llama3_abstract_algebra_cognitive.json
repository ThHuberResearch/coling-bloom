The task does not require explanation, application, analysis, evaluation, or creation of new ideas. It simply requires the student to recall and reproduce the statements, which is a characteristic of the \"Remember\" category.", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYour task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy.
