Analysis of the relationship is further complicated by modern political conflicts and the application of Westphalian sovereignty to a time when the concept did not exist. Some Mainland Chinese scholars, such as Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, assert that the Ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over Tibet, pointing to the Ming court's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders, Tibetans' full acceptance of these titles, and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital. Scholars within China also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of suzerainty, that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it simply paid tribute until the Jiajing Emperor (1521\u20131566), who ceased relations with Tibet.\nClassification:\n"], ["The given problem can be classified under the \"Remember\" category in Bloom's taxonomy.\n\nThe question \"Which company produces the iPod?\" requires the recall of a basic fact, which is that Apple Inc. produces the iPod line of portable media players.

This requires the learner to explain the concept of the genome and the areas of science that are involved in its study. The context provided gives information about the genome, describing it as the genetic material of an organism, consisting of DNA or RNA. This suggests that the learner needs to understand the concept of the genome and recognize the relevant fields of science, such as molecular biology and genetics, where the genome is studied.\n\nThe \"Understand\" category in Bloom's taxonomy involves explaining ideas or concepts, which aligns with the requirements of this problem. The learner needs to demonstrate their understanding of the genome and identify the appropriate fields of science where it is studied.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification of this problem is \"Understand\" in Bloom's taxonomy.", "Your task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy.

This is in contrast to the selective school system, where admission is restricted on the basis of selection criteria. The term is commonly used in relation to England and Wales, where comprehensive schools were introduced on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965. About 90% of British secondary school pupils now attend comprehensive schools.
