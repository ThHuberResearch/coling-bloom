Scholars within China also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of suzerainty, that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it simply paid tribute until the Jiajing Emperor (1521\u20131566), who ceased relations with Tibet.\nClassification:\n"], ["Based on the given context, the problem \"Which company produces the iPod?\" can be classified under the Factual Knowledge category of Bloom's taxonomy.\n\nThe context provided clearly states that the iPod is \"designed and marketed by Apple Inc.\", which is the basic factual information required to answer the given question.
