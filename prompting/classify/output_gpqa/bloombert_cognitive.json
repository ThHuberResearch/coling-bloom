Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this \"\"impulse\"\" approximation?\n\n1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\n2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\n3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\n4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\nClassification:\n"]]
