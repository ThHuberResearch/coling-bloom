To find \\(8x\\), multiply \\(x\\) by 8: \\(8x = 8 \\times 2 = 16\\).\n\nGiven that the problem involves using algebraic manipulation to find the value of \\(8x\\), it requires the application of learned concepts to solve the problem. \n\nThus, the problem classifies into the \"Apply\" category of Bloom's taxonomy.", "Your task is to classify tasks into Bloom's taxonomy.
