The classes and their description are provided below:\nMetacognitive: Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one's own cognition.\n\nProcedural: How to do something, methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, and methods.\n\nConceptual: The interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function together.\n\nFactual: The basic elements students must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it.\nClassify the following problem into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy:\n\nA line segment has one endpoint at $(3,9)$ and midpoint at $(1,2)$. What is the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint?\n\nClassification:\n"]]
