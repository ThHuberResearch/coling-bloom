In those days, farmers needed their children to have long breaks during which they could remain at home and help with the harvest.

It is clear that in doing so the mayor is sacrificing the city's interests to personal interests. The mayor cites figures to show that, in the current market, fees of the size proposed would significantly reduce the number of building starts and thus, on balance, result in a revenue loss to the city. But the important point is that the mayor's family is heavily involved in real estate development and thus has a strong financial interest in the matter.\nThe reasoning in the city council member's argument is flawed because\n(A)the issue of the mayor's personal interest in the proposed legislation is irrelevant to any assessment of the mayor's action with respect to that legislation (B)the mayor's course of action being personally advantageous is not inconsistent with the mayor's action being advantageous for the city (C)the council member's own absence of personal interest in the proposed legislation has not been established (D)that a person or a municipality has a need for something does not, in itself, establish that that person or that municipality has a right to that thing (E)the possibility remains open that the mayor's need to avoid loss of family revenue is as desperate as the city's need to increase municipal revenue\nClassification:\n"], ["The given problem can be classified into the Conceptual category of Bloom's taxonomy.\n\nThe key aspect of the problem is the description of the interrelationships among the basic elements (sea temperature, vertical mixing of seawater, availability of nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and larger sea animals) that enable them to function together as a larger system.

A rise of just two degrees prevents the vertical mixing of seawater from different strata. This restricts the availability of upwelling nutrients to phytoplankton. Since zooplankton, which feed upon phytoplankton, feed the rest of the food chain, the declines are inevitable.\nWhich one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton?\n(A)It is a hypothesis supported by the fact that phytoplankton feed on upwelling nutrients. (B)It is intended to provide an example of the ways in which the vertical mixing of seawater affects feeding habits.

Some long-distance champions, however, win by being above average in speed or endurance only; therefore, being above average in both speed and endurance is not necessary. (B)Bicyclists who have only average speed are unlikely to win short races, but in a long-distance race such bicyclists can win if they have better-built bicycles than average and better endurance than average. Therefore, most bicycle races are not won by bicyclists with above-average speed. (C)Excellence in a particular swimming stroke is not always necessary in order for a swimmer to win a race that requires each swimmer to use several different strokes in sequence, and many swimmers win these races without being the best at any of the strokes. Therefore, anyone who does excel at all the strokes is almost certain to win. (D)Apples that are neither especially firm nor especially flavorful are unsuitable for baking; yet while flavor is essential for both baking and eating, many flavorful apples that are soft are suitable for eating. Hence, the apples that are best for eating need not be both firm and flavorful. (E)Most plants that are neither ornamental nor edible are useless and are thus classified as weeds; yet many such plants are useful for purposes other than food or ornamentation, and are thus not classified as weeds.
