The contemporary school year is thus made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. But agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens, so we can now make changes that serve the interests of children. Therefore, long breaks should be removed from the school calendar.\nWhich one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends?\n(A)During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned. (B)Children of farmers need to continue observing a school calendar made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks.

A rise of just two degrees prevents the vertical mixing of seawater from different strata. This restricts the availability of upwelling nutrients to phytoplankton. Since zooplankton, which feed upon phytoplankton, feed the rest of the food chain, the declines are inevitable.\nWhich one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton?\n(A)It is a hypothesis supported by the fact that phytoplankton feed on upwelling nutrients. (B)It is intended to provide an example of the ways in which the vertical mixing of seawater affects feeding habits. (C)It helps show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly. (D)It is offered as one reason that global warming must be curtailed. (E)It is offered in support of the idea that global warming poses a threat to all organisms.\nClassification:"

Yet many successful retailers excel in just one of the areas and meet competitors' standards for the other. Hence, a retailer's success need not depend on excellence in both areas.\nThe structure of the reasoning in the argument above is most parallel to that in which one of the following?\n(A)Runners who have only average speed and endurance are unlikely to win long-distance races. Some long-distance champions, however, win by being above average in speed or endurance only; therefore, being above average in both speed and endurance is not necessary. (B)Bicyclists who have only average speed are unlikely to win short races, but in a long-distance race such bicyclists can win if they have better-built bicycles than average and better endurance than average. Therefore, most bicycle races are not won by bicyclists with above-average speed. (C)Excellence in a particular swimming stroke is not always necessary in order for a swimmer to win a race that requires each swimmer to use several different strokes in sequence, and many swimmers win these races without being the best at any of the strokes. Therefore, anyone who does excel at all the strokes is almost certain to win. (D)Apples that are neither especially firm nor especially flavorful are unsuitable for baking; yet while flavor is essential for both baking and eating, many flavorful apples that are soft are suitable for eating. Hence, the apples that are best for eating need not be both firm and flavorful. (E)Most plants that are neither ornamental nor edible are useless and are thus classified as weeds; yet many such plants are useful for purposes other than food or ornamentation, and are thus not classified as weeds. Hence, not all inedible and non-ornamental plants are weeds.\nClassification:"

Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.\nEach of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:\n(A)The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants. (B)There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records. (C)XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff. (D)An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.

Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nWhich one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\n(A)In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights. (B)People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985. (C)Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread. (D)In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.
