An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.\nClassification:\n"], ["Based on the given context, the classification of the task \"is windows movie maker part of windows essentials\" into the corresponding category of Bloom's taxonomy is:\n\nFactual\n\nThe context clearly states that \"Windows Movie Maker (formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7) is a part of Windows Essentials software suite\".
