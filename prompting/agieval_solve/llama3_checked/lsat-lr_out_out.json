Despite this, the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is similar in both captivity and the wild.\n3. This seems counterintuitive, as one would expect leatherbacks in captivity to have a lower life expectancy due to the diseases.\n\nTo resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an explanation that reconciles the two seemingly contradictory facts. Let's examine the options:\n\n(A) This statement doesn't provide any insight into why leatherbacks in captivity have a similar life expectancy to those in the wild.\n\n(B) This is a general statement about sea turtles, but it doesn't address the specific issue of leatherbacks in captivity.\n\n(C) This statement provides a possible explanation: if most leatherbacks in the wild are killed by predators, then the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity might be similar because they are protected from predators.\n\n(D) This statement suggests that the artificial environment in captivity might not be optimal, but it doesn't explain why the life expectancy is similar to those in the wild.\n\n(E) This statement is unrelated to the issue at hand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.

The passage only says that physics papers reporting results from experiments using subsystems developed at various laboratories generally have authors from each laboratory, but it doesn't specify that the results are from experiments using subsystems developed at each laboratory.\n\n(E) This statement is actually the opposite of what the passage suggests. The passage implies that many technical articles have multiple authors, whereas this statement claims that most technical articles are authored solely by the researchers who conducted the experiments.\n\nSo, none of the options are definitively true based on the passage. However, if I had to choose one that is most likely to be true, I would choose (B) Most reports of clinical trials involving patients from several hospitals have multiple authors.",

        "question": "Challenge can be an important source of self-knowledge, since those who pay attention to how they react, both emotionally and physically, to challenge can gain useful insights into their own weaknesses.\nWhich one of the following most closely conforms to the principle above?\n(A)A concert pianist should not have an entirely negative view of a memory lapse during a difficult performance. By understanding why the memory lapse occurred, the pianist can better prepare for future performances.\n(B)A salesperson should understand that the commission earned is not the only reward of making a sale. Salespeople should also take satisfaction from the fact that successful sales reflect well on their personalities.\n(C)Compassion is valuable not only for the wonderful feelings it brings, but also for the opportunities it affords to enrich the lives of other people.\n(D)While some of the value of competition comes from the pleasure of winning, the primary reward of competition is competition itself.\n(E)Even people who dread public speaking should accept invitations to speak before large groups.

Option (B) resolves this discrepancy by suggesting that early humans developed languages, which provided an alternative and more effective way of maintaining social cohesion, making social grooming unnecessary.

        "question": "As a general rule, the larger a social group of primates, the more time its members spend grooming one another. The maio purpose of this social grooming is the maintenance of social cohesion. Furthermore, group size among primates tends to increase proportionally with the size of the neocortex, the seat of higher thought in the brain. Extrapolating upon the relationship between group size and neocortex size, we can infer that early human groups were quite large.

However, option (D) suggests that most subscribers are individuals, not libraries, and that the subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged. This implies that the increased subscription rates paid by libraries may not be representative of the overall profitability of publishing scholarly journals. If individual subscribers, who make up the majority of subscribers, are not paying more, then the increased revenue from libraries may not be enough to significantly increase the profitability of journal publishing.

However, if the amount of fresh water available varies significantly from region to region, it's possible that some areas may already be experiencing water shortages or may be more vulnerable to water scarcity in the future, even if the global average suggests that there is plenty of fresh water available.

The passage states: \"If the budget does not allow for more dairy inspectors to be hired, most of the large dairies in the central valley will not meet federal standards governing the disposal of natural wastes...\"\n2. The passage then states: \"The new district budget, however, does not allow for the hiring of more dairy inspectors.\"\n3.

The logical connection between the lack of dairy inspectors and the pollution of drinking water is the disposal of natural wastes, which can seep into streams and groundwater.\n6.

However, if the amount of the chemical in grapefruit juice is highly unpredictable from glass to glass, it would be difficult to determine the correct amount of grapefruit juice to take with the medicine. This would make it challenging to achieve the desired effect and avoid potential harm.

Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.\n(B)Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.\n(C)Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.\n(D)When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.\n(E)Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals.

The start-up costs for ostrich farming are greater, but it can eventually bring in as much as five times what cattle ranching does.\nWhich one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\n(A)Two pairs of yearling ostriches are more expensive than a herd of cows and a bull.\n(B)Cattle ranching is not a good source of income.\n(C)A cow consumes no more feed than an ostrich does.\n(D)The average ostrich farm generates almost five times as much profit as the average cattle ranch.\n(E)Ostrich farmers typically lose money during their first year.",

We need to find the explanation for this unexpected result.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) This statement doesn't provide any information about why the commute time increased. It simply states that most people who work in downtown Gastner commute from the suburbs.\n\n(B) This option seems promising, but it doesn't explain why the commute time increased. If the location of the new highway is convenient for people who commute from the largest suburbs, it should reduce their commute time, not increase it.\n\n(C) This option could be a possible explanation. If several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights, it could potentially slow down traffic and increase commute time. However, it's not a very convincing explanation, as it's unlikely that new stoplights alone would cause a significant increase in commute time.\n\n(D) This option is a strong contender. If road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner at the same time the new highway was being built, it could have caused traffic congestion and increased commute time. This is a plausible explanation for why the new highway didn't reduce commute time.\n\n(E) This option is also a strong contender. If traffic on the roads near the new highway became more congested after the new highway was opened, it could have increased commute time. This suggests that the new highway might have attracted more traffic to the area, leading to congestion and longer commute times.\n\nAfter considering all the options, I think (D) and (E) are the most plausible explanations.

So one should not regret the missed opportunities of youth, for had one decided instead to seize one of these opportunities, one would not have some of the close personal relationships one currently has. And everyone deeply cherishes their close personal relationships.\nWhich one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?\n(A)One should not regret making a decision unless a different decision would have resulted in one having a greater number of close personal relationships.\n(B)One should not regret making a decision if it helped to bring about something that one cherishes.\n(C)One should not regret making a decision that had little effect on one's life.\n(D)People who regret the missed opportunities of youth should cherish their close personal relationships more deeply.\n(E)People with few close personal relationships should cherish the ones they have.",

This explanation makes sense of the babblers' behavior, as they are not just putting themselves at risk but also helping others.\n\nThe other options do not provide a clear explanation for the babblers' behavior:\n\n(A) Faster flying speed doesn't explain why babblers would sound an alarm call.\n(B) Predator intimidation by large numbers of babblers doesn't explain why the babblers would continue calling after taking cover.\n(C) Multiple predator types doesn't provide a reason for the babblers' behavior.\n(D) Predator eyesight vs. hearing abilities doesn't explain the babblers' behavior either.",
        "question": "Babblers, a bird species, live in large cooperative groups. Each member attempts to defend the group by sounding a loud barklike call when it spots a predator, inciting the others to bark too. Babblers, however, are extremely well camouflaged and could usually feed safely, unnoticed by predators. These predators, indeed, generally become aware of the presence of babblers only because of their shrill barks, which continue long after most members of the group have been able to take cover and which signal the group 's approximate location to the predators.\nWhich one of the following, if true, would most help to explain the babblers ' strange behavior?\n(A)Babblers fly much faster than the predators that prey upon them.\n(B)Babblers ' predators are generally intimidated by large numbers of babblers.\n(C)There is more than one type of predator that preys upon babblers.\n(D)Babblers ' predators have very good eyesight but relatively weak hearing.\n(E)Animals that live in close proximity to babblers are also preyed upon by the predators that prey upon babblers.",

It is a puzzle, then, why the foundation chose not to rebuild the eighteenth-century baroque organ originally designed for the church and instead built a modem organ, even though a donor had offered to pay the full cost of rebuilding the original.\nWhich one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the puzzle described above?\n(A)An eighteenth-century baroque organ cannot adequately produce much of the organ music now played in church services and concerts.\n(B)The organ originally designed for the church had some features that modem organs lack.\n(C)The donation for rebuilding the originaleighteenth-century baroque organ was designated for that purpose alone.\n(D)By the time the church was destroyed in World War II, the eighteenth-century baroque organ had been modified several times.\n(E)In the eighteenth century, the organ playedan important role in church services at the Frauenkirche.",

Thus the Decade is the best-selling model in the country.\n\nThe flawed reasoning in the original argument is that it assumes that because Bliss is the most popular program on YXK, which is the network with the highest overall number of viewers, Bliss must have more viewers than any other program on television. However, this ignores the possibility that another network may have a program that is more popular than Bliss, even if YXK has more viewers overall.\n\nSimilarly, in option (C), the argument assumes that because the Decade is the best-selling model from the Olson Motor Company, which manufactures the three best-selling models in the country, the Decade must be the best-selling model in the country. However, this ignores the possibility that another company may have a model that sells even better than the Decade, even if the Olson Motor Company has the top three models.",
        "question": "YXK is currently the television network with the highest overall number of viewers. Among YXK's programs, Bliss has the highest numbers of viewers. So Bliss currently has more viewers than any other program on television.\nThe flawed reasoning exhibited by the argument above is most similar to that exhibited by which one of the following?\n(A)Soccer players suffer more leg injuries, on average, than any other athletes at this university. Linda Wilson has suffered more leg injuries than any other soccer player at this university. Thus, Linda Wilson is the athlete at this university who has suffered the most leg injuries.\n(B)Teachers at our school have won more teaching awards, on average, than teachers at any other school in this city. Janna Patel is the teacher who has won the most awards in the city. So Janna Patel is the best teacher at our school.\n(C)The Olson Motor Company manufactures the three best-selling automobile models in the country. The Decade is the Olson Motor Company's best-selling model. Thus the Decade is the best-selling model in the country.\n(D)In this city the highest-paid police officer earns more than the highest-paid firefighter, and the lowest-paid police officer earns more than the lowest-paid firefighter. So in this city police officers earn more, on average, than firefighters do.\n(E)Falling Fast is the film that is currently earning the most at the box office in the country. The most successful film in the country is typically the one that is showing in the most theaters. So Falling Fast is probably the film that is currently showing in the most theaters.",
