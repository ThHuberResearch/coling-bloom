We also know that the total revenue from selling salads and drinks is $\\$836.50$, and that salads cost $\\$6.50$each and drinks cost$\\$2.00$ each. Therefore, the total revenue can be expressed as $6.50s+2.00d=836.50$. We can solve this system of equations by substituting $d=209-s$ into the second equation: \\begin{align*}\n6.50s+2.00(209-s)&=836.50\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad6.50s+418-2.00s&=836.50\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad4.50s&=418.50\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad s&=418.50/4.50=93.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the number of salads sold was $\\boxed{\\text{(B)}\\;93}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 93.",

A new data set is created by adding 96 to the original data set, making it a set of 26 positive integers.\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\n(A) The mean:\nThe mean of the original data set is the sum of all 25 integers divided by 25.

It's possible that the median remains the same or changes by a different amount, so it's not necessarily 12 greater.\n\n(C) The range:\nThe range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set. In the original data set, the maximum value is 84, and the range is 84 - minimum value. In the new data set, the maximum value is 96, so the range is 96 - minimum value.

We know the formula for weight is W = mg, where W is the weight, m is the mass of the object, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n3. We are told that the mass of the object is the same on all planets, so we can set up a proportion to relate the weights on different planets:\n\nW_Earth / g_Earth = W_Planet / g_Planet\n\nwhere W_Earth = 150 N, g_Earth = 9.8 m/s^2, and W_Planet = 170 N.\n\n4.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w. In this case, P = 2(2.5x) + 2x = 5x + 2x = 7x.\n\n2. The sum of the perimeter of the base and the height cannot exceed 130 inches. So, we can set up the inequality: 7x + 60 \u2264 130.\n\n3. To solve for x, subtract 60 from both sides of the inequality: 7x \u2264 130 - 60, which gives 7x \u2264 70.\n\n4. Divide both sides of the inequality by 7: x \u2264 70/7, which simplifies to x \u2264 10.\n\n5. Since the width cannot be negative, we can add the condition 0 < x to the inequality.

This means we need to subtract 10 pounds from the lowest weight.\n\n2. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest weights. Since we subtracted 10 pounds from the lowest weight, the range will change (it will be 10 pounds larger).\n\n3. The median is the middle value in the dataset when it is arranged in order. If we subtract 10 pounds from the lowest weight, the median may or may not change, depending on the original dataset. If the lowest weight was the median, then the median will change. If the median was one of the other values, it will remain the same.\n\n4. The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data.
