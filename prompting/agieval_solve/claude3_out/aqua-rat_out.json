Understand the given information:\n   - The car is being driven in a straight line and at a uniform speed towards the base of a vertical tower.\n   - The angle of elevation of the top of the tower changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 10 minutes.\n   - We need to find the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\n2. Analyze the geometric relationship:\n   - Let's define the following variables:\n     - d: the distance between the car and the base of the tower\n     - h: the height of the tower\n   - Using trigonometry, we can write the following equations:\n     - tan(45\u00b0) = h/d\n     - tan(60\u00b0) = h/d'\n   - Where d' is the distance between the car and the base of the tower at the moment the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0.\n\n3. Find the change in distance:\n   - The change in distance between the car and the base of the tower is d' - d.\n   - Using the trigonometric equations, we can solve for d' - d:\n     d' - d = h(cot(45\u00b0) - cot(60\u00b0))\n     d' - d = h(\u221a3 - 1/\u221a3)\n\n4. Calculate the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower:\n   - We know that the car is moving at a uniform speed, so the time it takes to cover the distance d' - d is proportional to the distance.\n   - The time taken for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 is 10 minutes.\n   - Therefore, the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is:\n     Additional time = 10 minutes * (d' - d) / d = 10 minutes * (\u221a3 - 1/\u221a3)\n\n5. Evaluate the result:\n   - The additional time is given by the expression:\n     Additional time = 10 minutes * (\u221a3 - 1/\u221a3)\n   - Simplifying the expression, we get:\n     Additional time = 5(\u221a3 + 1) minutes\n   - Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5(\u221a3 + 1).",

Find the discounted amount:\n   - The discounted amount = $20,000 - (4% of $20,000) = $20,000 - $800 = $19,200\n\n3. Calculate the maximum simple interest rate:\n   - The merchant wants to borrow money to take advantage of the discount.\n   - Let's assume the merchant borrows the discounted amount of $19,200 and pays it back after n days.\n   - The simple interest formula is: Simple Interest = (Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time) / 100\n   - The merchant wants to find the highest simple interest rate at which they can afford to borrow money.\n   - We can rearrange the simple interest formula to find the rate:\n     Rate = (Simple Interest \u00d7 100) / (Principal \u00d7 Time)\n\n4. Solve for the simple interest rate:\n   - The merchant has 30 days to pay the discounted amount and receive the 4% discount.\n   - The simple interest rate should be the highest possible rate that allows the merchant to pay back the discounted amount within 30 days.\n   - Substituting the values in the simple interest formula:\n     Rate = (Simple Interest \u00d7 100) / ($19,200 \u00d7 30)\n     Rate = (Simple Interest \u00d7 100) / ($576,000)\n     Simple Interest = (Rate \u00d7 $576,000) / 100\n\n5. Find the highest simple interest rate:\n   - The highest simple interest rate that allows the merchant to pay back the discounted amount within 30 days is the one that makes the simple interest equal to the difference between the full amount and the discounted amount.\n   - Difference between full amount and discounted amount = $20,000 - $19,200 = $800\n   - Substituting this in the simple interest formula:\n     $800 = (Rate \u00d7 $576,000) / 100\n     Rate = ($800 \u00d7 100) / $576,000\n     Rate = 0.1388 or 13.88%\n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount is 13.88%, which corresponds to option (C) 227.67.",
