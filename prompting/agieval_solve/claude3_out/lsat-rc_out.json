Their job is to advocate for the client, not judge them.\n\n2. Defense lawyers have a dual obligation - to the defendant and to the court/society.

These forms were often collaborative, with the tribe actively contributing to the individual's narrative.\n\n4. The passage concludes by stating that these autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them, and that they differ from the European style of autobiography.\n\nBased on this, the answer that most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the passage is:\n\n(D) Early Native Americans created autobiographies with forms and underlying assumptions that frequently differ from those of European-style autobiographies.\n\nThis captures the key point that the passage is making - that Native American autobiographical expressions had different forms and assumptions compared to the European conception of autobiography.",

This suggests the author's view that the earlier scholarship was inadequate in addressing the diversity of Native American cultures.\n\n3. The passage then explains how the idea of \"self\" was \"markedly inclusive\" in many pre-contact Native American cultures, in contrast with the European concept of autobiography (lines 16-17).

For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.\nThe author suggests each of the following in the passage EXCEPT:\n(A)Greater platelet adhesiveness increases the risk of premature heart disease.\n(B)The body's ability to process lipids is compromised by the presence of alcohol in the bloodstream.\n(C)Doctors have access to a natural compound that breaks down blood clots.\n(D)High lipid levels are dangerous because they lead to increased endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness.\n(E)Moderate wine consumption appears to decrease the thickness of the interior walls of blood vessels.\n",
        "question": "Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists\u2014who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages\u2014have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects\u2014for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease\u2014the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased.

But when Marshall's career is viewed from a technical perspective, his work with the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) reveals a strategic and methodological legacy to the field of public interest law. Though the NAACP, under Marshall's direction, was not the first legal organization in the U.S. to be driven by a political and social agenda, he and the NAACP developed innovations that forever changed the landscape of public interest law: during the 1940s and 1950s, in their campaign against state-sanctioned racial segregation, Marshall and the NAACP, instead of simply pursuing cases as the opportunity arose, set up a predetermined legal campaign that was meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated. One aspect of this campaign, the test case strategy, involved sponsoring litigation of tactically chosen cases at the trial court level with careful evaluation of the precedential nuances and potential impact of each decision.

The passage discusses Lichtenstein's use of comic book elements in his paintings and how this helped define the pop art movement.\n2. It explains that while Lichtenstein's work may have initially appeared to be a parodic reaction to the pretensions of the art world, it also conveyed a seriousness of theme that transcended mere parody.\n3. The passage contrasts Lichtenstein's work with the abstract expressionism movement, stating that Lichtenstein wasn't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work, but rather with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed \"airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical.\"\n4. The passage suggests that Lichtenstein's use of comic book elements was not just a parodic reaction, but also an attempt to depict contemporary life and culture, with a sense of \"deliberate naivete\" in response to the excess of sophistication he observed.\n5.

        "target": "B",
        "prompt": "Solve the following task. Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nThe painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art\u2014the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings\u2014 by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited.

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nBecause the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources\u2014and in numbers once thought impossible\u2014can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem\u2014 which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies\u2014has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power.

Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population.

According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.\nWhich one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?\n(A)Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.\n(B)Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.\n(C)Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.\n(D)Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.\n(E)Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.\n",

It then introduces an alternative theory that communication between neurons is achieved through chemical rather than electrical means.\n\n2. The passage then explains this alternative theory in more detail, describing how neurotransmitters bind to receptors in the receiving neuron, which then allows ions to flow into the cell and generate an electrical impulse.\n\n3. The passage notes that this chemical theory of neurotransmission has gradually gained acceptance, but that the mechanism by which neurotransmitters render the receiving neuron permeable to ions was not well understood for a long time.\n\n4. The passage then describes the recent evidence that has provided a convincing explanation for this mechanism. It explains that the structure of the receptors, which contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and an ion channel, is the key to converting the chemical signal into electrical activity.\n\n5. The passage also discusses the discovery that there are different varieties of these neurotransmitter-gated ion channel receptors, which has significant medical implications.\n\nBased on this analysis, the primary purpose of the passage is most likely to (D) discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain.\n\nThe passage does not propose a new theory (A), but rather describes evidence that supports the alternative theory of chemical neurotransmission, which has become widely accepted. It does not introduce evidence that challenges a widely accepted theory (B), but rather provides evidence that supports it.

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nNeurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin.

The passage suggests that altruistic mechanisms may have initially applied to kin-based groups and later extended to non-kin as human communities grew larger.\n\n2. Evaluate the answer choices:\n(A) This is incorrect. The passage does not say that altruistic behavior diminishes reproductive success, but rather that it poses a problem for evolutionary psychology to explain.\n(B) This is the most accurate summary of the main point. The passage explains how new evidence may account for the evolution of altruistic behavior.\n(C) This is partially correct, but the passage does not suggest that altruistic behavior no longer serves evolutionary purposes today.\n(D) This goes too far. The passage does not say that most significant human behavior is genetically selfish. It focuses specifically on the issue of altruism.\n(E) This is also a valid summary, but it is not the main point of the passage. The passage focuses more on how altruistic mechanisms may have evolved, rather than just on the psychological states that may have caused them.\n\n3. Select the best answer:\nThe best answer is (B), as it most accurately captures the main point of Passage A regarding the evolutionary psychology explanation for the development of altruistic behavior.",

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nPassage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution\u2014to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically \"selfish\" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.\nWhich one of the following most accurately states the main point of passage A?\n(A)Altruistic behavior is problematic for evolutionary psychology because it tends to diminish the reproductive success of individuals that exhibit it.\n(B)New evidence may explain the evolution of altruistic behavior in early humans by showing that genes promote their own self-propagation.\n(C)Altruistic behavior originally served evolutionary purposes that it does not serve today because humans no longer live in small, kin-based groups.\n(D)Contrary to what critics of evolutionary psychology say, most significant types of human behavior are prompted by genetically selfish motivations.\n(E)An evolutionary explanation of altruistic behavior may lie in the psychological states brought about in early humans by cues of kinship or familiarity.\n",

From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically \"selfish\" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest.

Dostoyevsky defined \"artistry\" as the ability to express the author's thoughts through well-written characters and images, so the reader fully understands the author's ideas.\n\nGiven these key points, the work that most clearly exemplifies writing Dostoyevsky would have deemed \"artistic\" is:\n(B) a novel in which the author's ideas are given substance through suitable characters and events.\n\nThis option aligns with Dostoyevsky's view that a work should be judged on its artistic merit, not just its utilitarian purpose.

It suggests that digital publishing is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing due to its economic efficiency and convenience for customers.\n\nStep 2: Identify the key points made in the passage.\n1. Digital books can be printed on demand at the point of sale, making them indistinguishable from traditionally published books.\n2. Once books are digitized, anyone with access to the Internet can purchase printed books from a practically limitless digital catalog.\n3. Digital publishing eliminates the costs associated with physical inventory, warehousing, shipping, and displaying books in retail stores.\n4. The elimination of these expenses means that authors would be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds under the digital publishing model.\n5. Traditional publishers will be reluctant to accept the higher royalty demands of authors, leading to opportunities for upstart digital-publishing firms.\n6. Traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions to accommodate higher royalty payments or risk losing their authors.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the statements and choose the most reasonable inference.\n(A) is the most reasonable inference based on the passage. The passage suggests that traditional publishers will need to adapt and reduce their redundant functions to remain competitive in the face of the shift to digital publishing.\n(B) is not supported by the passage, which focuses on the advantages of digital publishing rather than any threats to its spread.\n(C) is not a reasonable inference, as the passage does not mention any potential revitalization of the book retail business.\n(D) is not supported by the passage, which does not make any claims about the sales performance of digitally published books compared to traditionally published ones.\n(E) is not mentioned in the passage, which does not discuss the impact of digital publishing on advertising budgets.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable inference based on the passage is (A).",

The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of \"points of identification\" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability.

Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique \"voices\" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.\nWhich one of the following most accurately states the main point of the passage?\n(A)In Jazz, Morrison has realized a significant artistic achievement in creating the first African American work of fiction whose plot, themes, and setting are all drawn from the world of jazz.\n(B)Morrison's striking description of a musical ensemble perfurmance containing solo improvisations constitutes an important artistic innovation and makes Jazz an important model for other writers.\n(C)Although many African American writers have used music as a central metaphor in their works, Morrison's 1992 novel is unique and innovative for using jazz as its central metaphor.\n(D)Building on the works of many African American writers and musical composers, Morrison has over the years developed an innovative jazzlike style of narration, which she used especially effectively in the novel Jazz.\n(E)In Jazz, Morrison has succeeded in creating an original and effective narrative strategy that is a literary analogne of Duke Ellington's style of musical composition.\n",

Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.\nWhich one of the following most accurately states the main point of the passage?\n(A)In Jazz, Morrison has realized a significant artistic achievement in creating the first African American work of fiction whose plot, themes, and setting are all drawn from the world of jazz.\n(B)Morrison's striking description of a musical ensemble perfurmance containing solo improvisations constitutes an important artistic innovation and makes Jazz an important model for other writers.\n(C)Although many African American writers have used music as a central metaphor in their works, Morrison's 1992 novel is unique and innovative for using jazz as its central metaphor.\n(D)Building on the works of many African American writers and musical composers, Morrison has over the years developed an innovative jazzlike style of narration, which she used especially effectively in the novel Jazz.\n(E)In Jazz, Morrison has succeeded in creating an original and effective narrative strategy that is a literary analogne of Duke Ellington's style of musical composition."

Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, \"El Corrido de Kiansis\" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: \"I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me.\" Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including \"Kiansis,\" which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another.

For example, \"El Corrido de Kiansis\" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: \"I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me.\" Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including \"Kiansis,\" which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of \"Gregorio Cortez\" is translated as follows: \"Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez.\" The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme.

The \"Pin Factory\" concept emphasizes the huge increases in efficiency that can be achieved through increased size and specialization of workers. Smith observed this in a pin factory.\n\n3. The \"Invisible Hand\" concept describes how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good. Businesses sell products that people want, not because they want to please people, but because it enables them to make money.\n\n4. However, these two concepts are opposed to each other.

The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though \"by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.\" For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace.

The author explains that the \"Pin Factory\" concept leads to increasing returns to scale, which in turn creates a natural tendency towards monopoly, as larger firms can achieve lower costs and drive out smaller firms.\n\nThe question asks which option, if true, would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) This option suggests that even though there are larger businesses in the same industry, some businesses can still exert monopoly power in certain geographical regions. This would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as larger size does not necessarily lead to monopoly power in all cases.\n\n(B) This option is not relevant to the main argument, as it is about the impact of specialization on worker salaries, not the relationship between size and monopoly power.\n\n(C) This option actually supports the author's argument, as it suggests that even in an industry dominated by a few players, those businesses can collude to create a monopoly-like situation.\n\n(D) This option would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it suggests that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely across industries. This means that increased size may not always lead to monopoly power.\n\n(E) This option is not relevant to the main argument, as it is about the potential drawbacks of increased specialization, not the relationship between size and monopoly power.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) - \"The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.\"",

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nDavid Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though \"by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.\" For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale\u2014the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this \"underground river\" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought.

Passage A explains that law enforcement agencies can sometimes \"nullify\" or decline to prosecute violations of certain laws. This is because the rules of law are often \"overinclusive\" - they forbid some conduct that the legislature did not intend to forbid.\n\n2. The passage suggests that enforcing such overinclusive rules to the letter could impose \"very heavy social costs.\" To avoid this, law enforcement agencies may exercise discretionary non-enforcement, which allows them to reduce the costs of overinclusion without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes).\n\n3. The passage notes that \"capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare)\" but that it is unlikely to be the \"central tendency\" because legislative oversight ensures that the agency does not stray too far from the \"intended\" regulation.\n\n4. Now, let's apply this to the situation in Passage B. The passage suggests that the city is planning to selectively cut water to high-income neighborhoods to make examples of a few privileged residents, even though property owners are responsible for water bills.\n\n5. Based on the explanation in Passage A, this selective enforcement targeting specific groups (high-income neighborhoods) rather than applying the law consistently could be considered an instance of \"capricious enforcement.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer that best fits the concept of \"capricious enforcement\" presented in Passage A is:\n(D) not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.\n\nThe city's plan to selectively target high-income neighborhoods, rather than consistently applying the law to all delinquent water customers, suggests that they are not following the intent of the law, which is to collect outstanding water bills, regardless of the customers' income level.",

This answer choice is not strongly supported by the information given.\n\n(C) The prevention of CJD would be most efficiently achieved by the prevention of certain genetic abnormalities.\nThe passage does not mention anything about genetic abnormalities being involved in the development of CJD.

The passage states that prions are a new type of infectious agent, lacking nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), and consisting mainly of protein. Prions are normally present in the body as harmless cellular proteins, but can transform into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation.\n\n2. This abnormal conformation of prions is believed to be the cause of CJD. The passage explains that the abnormal prions can initiate a chain reaction, transforming normally shaped prions into the pathogenic conformation, leading to the formation of a plaque that destroys nerve cells in the brain.\n\n3. The passage also mentions that the discovery of prions as the cause of CJD was initially met with skepticism, but subsequent research has supported this conclusion.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n(A) This option would not undermine the claim that prions cause CJD, as it only suggests that other viral infections can produce symptoms similar to CJD, but does not directly challenge the role of prions in causing CJD.\n\n(B) This option does not undermine the claim that prions cause CJD. The lack of effective therapies to block the chain reaction of prion reproduction does not negate the evidence that prions are the causative agent.\n\n(C) This option would undermine the claim that prions cause CJD, as it suggests that prions may be linked to degenerative conditions not affecting the brain or central nervous system. If prions were found to be involved in non-neurological diseases, it would cast doubt on the specific role of prions in causing CJD.\n\n(D) This option does not undermine the claim that prions cause CJD. The lack of a hereditary predisposition to CJD does not contradict the proposed mechanism of prion-based transmission and disease causation.\n\n(E) This option would undermine the claim that prions cause CJD, as it suggests that an antibacterial drug can effectively reverse the onset of CJD. If a non-prion-based treatment can be effective against CJD, it would challenge the central role of prions in the disease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E), as a newly developed antibacterial drug that can reverse the onset of CJD would most undermine the claim that prions are the causative agent of the disease.",

The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections\u2014viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites\u2014reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term \"prion\" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.\nWhich one of the following, if true, would most undermine the claim that prions cause CJD?\n(A)Several symptoms closely resembling those of CJD have been experienced by patients known to have a specific viral infection.\n(B)None of the therapies currently available for treating neurological diseases is designed to block the chain reaction by which abnormal prions are believed to reproduce.\n(C)Research undertaken subsequent to the studies on CJD has linked prions to degenerative conditions not affecting the brain or the central nervous system.\n(D)Epidemiological studies carried out on a large population have failed to show any hereditary predisposition to CJD.\n(E)A newly developed antibacterial drug currently undergoing clinical trials is proving to be effective in reversing the onset of CJD.\n",

This is somewhat closer to Dunham's work, as it involves the integration of techniques from different cultures. However, it still does not specifically relate to the study and incorporation of traditional dance forms.\n\n(D) This option describes a Brazilian teacher with training in social psychology who conducts a study of teaching procedures in several Asian countries, and then introduces the most effective of those procedures to teachers in his own country. This is the most analogous to Dunham's work, as it involves the study of practices in various cultures and the integration of those practices into the researcher's own context.\n\n(E) This option describes an Italian fashion designer who researches the social significance of clothing design in several cultures and then presents his research in a book directed toward his colleagues in fashion design. While this involves the study of cultural practices, it does not involve the active integration of those practices into new creative works, as Dunham did with her choreography.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the option that is most analogous to Dunham's work is (D), the Brazilian teacher with training in social psychology who conducts a study of teaching procedures in several Asian countries and then introduces the most effective of those procedures to teachers in his own country.",

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nPassage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena\u2014habituation and rivalry\u2014push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the \"required income\" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase.

Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first.

This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success\u2014not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value.

Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena\u2014habituation and rivalry\u2014push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the \"required income\" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first.

This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk.

The author suggests that the purpose of the risk-taking activity should be considered, not just whether the risk is deemed \"voluntary.\"\nB) This statement is consistent with the author's view that the distinction between \"voluntary\" and \"involuntary\" risk is not always clear-cut, and that policy experts should focus on the aggregate lives at stake rather than the voluntariness of the risk.\nC) This statement is not directly addressed in the passage. The passage does not make any comparisons between the probabilities of different types of risks.\nD) This statement is in line with the author's point that the voluntariness of a risk is not an all-or-nothing matter but rather a matter of degree. The passage suggests that even risks like airline travel, which are often considered \"involuntary,\" involve an element of choice.\nE) This statement is consistent with the author's example of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid as a case where the risk is truly involuntary. However, the passage suggests that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not always clear-cut, even in the case of natural disasters.\n\nStep 3: Determine the most likely answer.\nBased on the analysis, the statement that the author would most likely agree with is (B), as it aligns with the author's view that the distinction between \"voluntary\" and \"involuntary\" risk is not always a relevant factor for policy experts in making decisions about risk regulation.",

        "question": "It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk\u2014by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is \"involuntary\" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as \"voluntary\" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like \"voluntary\" and \"involuntary.\" Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.\nWhich one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?\n(A)chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities\n(B)concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation\n(C)skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy\n(D)conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives\n(E)eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases"

The passage explores why great perfume is not taken as seriously as other art forms like literature, architecture, and music.\n2. It draws parallels between the creative processes of perfume-making and oil painting, noting that both involve the skilled combination of natural and synthetic elements to create a final work.\n3. The passage suggests that one reason great perfumes are undervalued is the influence of large corporations that prioritize profit over artistic integrity, often modifying formulas to use cheaper ingredients.\n4. The passage argues that truly great perfumes, like great works of art or music, have the power to evoke powerful emotional and sensory responses in the viewer/smeller.\n\nGiven this summary, the main point of the passage is most accurately captured by option (D): \"Great perfumes are works of art and deserve respect and attention as such.\"\n\nThe passage makes a strong case that perfume-making should be considered an artistic discipline on par with painting, music, and other fine arts. It argues that the lack of respect for perfumery as an art form is unjustified, and that truly exceptional perfumes deserve the same level of critical attention and appreciation as other revered artistic works.\n\nNone of the other options fully capture the essence of the passage's central argument. Option (A) is incorrect because the passage is critical of corporations for undermining artistic integrity in perfume-making. Option (B) is too narrow in focus, as the passage advocates for broader recognition of perfumery as an art form, not just the power of individual perfume \"masterpieces.\" Option (C) is also too narrow, as the passage identifies the corporate influence as one reason, not the sole reason, for the lack of respect for perfume as an art.",

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nPassage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves\u2014a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution\u2014the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts\u2014which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of \"soft determinism.\" He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions\u2014and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.\nBoth passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?\n(A)Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?\n(B)Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?\n(C)Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?\n(D)Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?\n(E)Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?\n",

It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of \"soft determinism.\" He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions\u2014and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.\nBoth passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?\n(A)Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?\n(B)Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?\n(C)Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?\n(D)Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?\n(E)Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?"

Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.\nWhich one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?\n(A)By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.\n(B)The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.\n(C)The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.\n(D)Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.\n(E)Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.\n",

In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.\nWhich one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?\n(A)By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.\n(B)The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.\n(C)The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.\n(D)Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.\n(E)Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research."

        "output": "To solve this problem, I will go through the passage step-by-step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the debate around intellectual property protection and patenting in the biotechnology industry. It mentions that academic researchers increasingly share the view that patenting should be allowed for discoveries with commercial potential.\n\n2. However, the passage also states that there are concerns that biotechnology patenting may be hindering basic research, due to restrictions on access to research materials like genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals.\n\n3. Some researchers fear that patent holders may try to prevent further research through legal action or by refusing to make materials available unless costly licensing agreements are made.\n\n4. The passage then argues that this fear is misplaced. It states that patent litigation is usually only initiated to protect a commercial market position, and that there is a tradition of a research exception in patent law. It also argues that patents can actually spur basic research by providing economic incentives.\n\n5. Given this, the academic researchers mentioned in lines 30-31 would be most likely to subscribe to the principle in option (B) - that the inventor of a biological material should not be allowed to charge fees that would prevent its use in basic research.\n\nThis is because the passage indicates these researchers oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology, fearing it will lead to prohibitively high fees for accessing patented materials, which would hinder basic research. Option (B) most directly captures this concern.\n\nThe other options do not align as well with the views expressed by these researchers in the passage.",

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nBefore contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes.

Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests.

For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.\nIt can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?\n(A)There is evidence that objects similar to wampum were used for symbolic representation by other peoples in addition to the Haudenosaune.\n(B)The Europeans who first came in contact with the Haudenosaune insisted on using wampum as a form of currency in spite of their awareness of its true significance.\n(C)There is evidence that Europeans who came incontact with the Haudenosaune adopted some long-standing Haudenosaune uses of wampum.\n(D)A long-term peaceful association among the groups that formed the Haudenosaune Confederacy was an important precondition for the use of wampum as a means of communication.\n(E)Present day interpretations of the significance of some of the symbols used in wampum belts are not conclusive."

Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.\nWhich one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?\n(A)Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.\n(B)By observing \"variable stars\" \u2014stars that vary in brightness\u2014in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.\n(C)Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.\n(D)Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.\n(E)When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed."

The passage discusses jury nullification, where a jury acquits a defendant despite the judge's instructions and the jury's own findings of fact.\n\n2. The author of Passage A argues against jury nullification, stating that it is problematic because:\n   - We don't know how often it is used, and whether it is used for good or bad ends.\n   - Jurors often lack sufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision.\n   - Jurors are unelected and unaccountable, and their decisions can have unintended effects.\n\n3. The author of Passage B, on the other hand, suggests that jury nullification can serve as a \"safety valve\" when police and prosecutors are overzealous, and can also indicate to the legislature that a law may be unjust.\n\n4. The question asks which type of law the author of Passage B suggests justifies the use of jury nullification.\n\n5. Based on the passage, the author of Passage B suggests that jury nullification is justified when a law is too \"general\" or broad, as legislatures cannot foresee every variation and must settle for broad language to get any law passed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) general.",

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nPassage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws.

Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction.

Passage A is focused on the problems created by jury nullification, not on the prosecutorial decision-making process.\n\n(B) Prosecutors are unlikely to present a case in a manner that makes it appear trivial to a jury.\nAgain, this is not a criticism that the author of Passage A would likely make. Passage A is not concerned with how prosecutors present their cases.\n\n(C) The members of a jury are unlikely to be in accord in their evaluation of a case's seriousness.\nThis is a criticism that the author of Passage A would likely offer. Passage A states that \"jurors are not legislators\" and that \"reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws.\" The author would likely argue that juries are not qualified to make such subjective evaluations of a case's seriousness, and that their differing perspectives would lead to inconsistent nullification decisions.\n\n(D) Jurors may not have sufficient expertise to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a case.\nThis is another criticism that the author of Passage A would likely make. Passage A states that \"jurors are not legislators\" and that \"evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence.\" The author would likely argue that jurors lack the necessary expertise to make informed decisions about the appropriateness of a conviction.\n\n(E) Jurors may not be aware of all the reasons why a case was brought against a defendant.\nThis is also a criticism that the author of Passage A would likely offer. Passage A states that \"jurors are not legislators\" and have \"no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others.\" The author would likely argue that jurors may not have a full understanding of the context and rationale behind the prosecution's decision to bring a case to trial.\n\nIn conclusion, the best answer is (D) Jurors may not have sufficient expertise to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a case, as this criticism aligns with the author's concerns about jury nullification expressed in Passage A.",

The sign for \"sheep,\" for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for \"metal\" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained.

A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil.

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nHundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for \"sheep,\" for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for \"metal\" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars.

Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.\nWhich one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the conclusions of Molina and Rowland concerning the long-term effects of CFCs in the stratosphere?\n(A)The hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica continued to grow for years after CFC emissions had almost ceased.\n(B)Other manufactured chemicals have been found to diffuse upward into the stratosphere when released into the troposphere.\n(C)Ozone has been shown to react more violently with chlorine than with many other chemicals.\n(D)Many scientists who in the 1 970s were highly critical of the research methods of Molina and Rowland have come to accept the soundness of their methods.\n(E)Current CFC levels in the troposphere suggest that not all nations currently abide by the Montreal Protocol."

The dominant approach in pre-Rawls political philosophy was utilitarianism, which emphasized maximizing the fulfillment of peopled preferences. At first sight, utilitarianism seems plausible-what else should we do but try to achieve the most satisfaction possible for the greatest number of people?-but the theory has some odd consequences. Suppose executing an innocent person will appease a mob, and that doing so will therefore increase total satisfaction. Incredibly, a utilitarian would have to endorse the execution. Rawls accordingly complains that, in the utilitarian view, there is no reason \"why the violation of the liberty of a few might not be made right by the greater good shared by many.\" If we reject utilitarianism and its view about the aim of the good life, how can we know what justice requires? Rawls offers an ingenious answer. He asserts that even if people do not agree on the aim of the good life, they can accept a fair procedure for settling what the principles of justice should be. This is key to Rawls's theory: Whatever arises from a fair procedure is just. But what is a fair procedure? Rawls again has a clever approach, beginning with his famous veil of ignorance. Suppose five children have to divide a cake among themselves. One child cuts the cake but does not know who will get which shares. The child is likely to divide the cake into equal shares to avoid the possibility of receiving the smallest share, an arrangement that the others will also admit to be fair. By denying the child information that would bias the result, a fair outcome can be achieved. Rawls generalizes the point of this example of the veil of ignorance. His thought experiment features a situation, which he calls the original position, in which people are self-interested but do not know their own station in life, abilities, tastes, or even gender. Under the limits of this ignorance, individuals motivated by self-interest endeavor to arrive at a solution in which they will not lose, because nobody loses. The result will be a just arrangement. Rawls thinks that people, regardless of their plan of life,want certain \"primary goods.\" These include rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, and income and wealth. Without these primary goods, people cannot accomplish their goals, whatever they may be. Hence, any individual in the original position will agree that everyone should get at least a minimum amount of these primary goods.

        "target": "D",
        "prompt": "Solve the following task. Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nPassage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: \"insider nontrading\"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market.

The passage starts by discussing the use of brain scans in medical diagnosis, which is straightforward and valuable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is different, as it relies on the premise of the modular theory of mind.\n\n2. The modular theory of mind suggests that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules or components, which are instantiated in localized brain regions. \n\n3. The passage then introduces a critique of the modular theory of mind, arguing that mental activity and the underlying physical processes may not be decomposable into independent modules. Instead, various mental processes may be properties of a more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain.\n\n4. The passage then addresses an apparent contradiction - if the modular theory of mind is invalid, how can brain scans reveal well-defined areas that \"light up\" in response to cognitive tasks?\n\n5. The passage explains that in the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the images are the result of a subtraction process. Baseline measurements are taken and then subtracted from the measurements taken during a cognitive task. The reasoning is that the remaining activity is associated solely with the cognitive task in question.\n\n6. The final paragraph suggests that this subtraction method may be problematic, as it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. This produces an impression of neat functional localization, which may be attractive because it is illustrated by the products of the subtractive method.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is (C) - the final paragraph is contending that the research method detailed in the third paragraph relies upon an outdated theoretical model described in the second paragraph (the modular theory of mind).\n\nThe passage suggests that the subtraction method used in fMRI research may be based on and reinforce the modular theory of mind, even though this theory is critiqued in the earlier part of the passage. The final paragraph is arguing that the empirical evidence from the fMRI research does not support the modular theory of mind, and instead points to the inadequacy of this underlying theoretical model.",

However, the passage argues that the entire brain is active in both the baseline and task conditions, and the modular theory of mind may be an oversimplification.\n\nThe most analogous scenario to this subtractive method of interpreting FMRI scans is option (B):\n\n(B) A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.\n\nThis is analogous because:\n- The store is looking at the differential increase in shoppers during the summer, just as the FMRI is looking at the differential increase in brain activity during the task.\n- This gives the impression that the advertising campaign only affected the summer shoppers, just as the FMRI gives the impression of localized brain activity.\n- However, just as the passage argues the entire brain is active in both conditions, the store's advertising campaign may have had an effect on shoppers throughout the year, not just in the summer.\n\nThe other options are not as directly analogous to the subtractive method of interpreting FMRI scans described in the passage.",

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nThere are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that \"light up,\" in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?\nWhich one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?\n(A)One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.\n(B)A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.\n(C)Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.\n(D)Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.\n(E)The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.\n",
