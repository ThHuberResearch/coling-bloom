Evaluate the given options:\n   (A) Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.\n       - This is possible, as it does not contradict any of the given constraints.\n   (B) Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.\n       - This is possible, as it does not contradict any of the given constraints.\n   (C) Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.\n       - This is possible, as it satisfies the constraint that Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\n   (D) Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.\n       - This is possible, as it does not contradict any of the given constraints.\n   (E) Olivia's session meets Friday morning.\n       - This is not possible, as Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon, according to the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E), as Olivia's session cannot meet on Friday morning.",
