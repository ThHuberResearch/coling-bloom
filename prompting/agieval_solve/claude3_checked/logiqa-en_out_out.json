The question asks which of the following is the best argument against the above argument.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Many Chinese people buy homes for their children to study in the US\nThis is a valid argument against the given argument. If the primary reason for Chinese buyers to purchase US real estate is to provide housing for their children studying in the US, then it is not necessarily an indication of transferring property abroad due to wealth accumulation in China.\n\nB. Although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year\nThis is not a strong argument against the given argument. The fact that the transaction volume increased by 23% compared to the previous year suggests that the number of Chinese buyers or the amount they are investing has increased, even if the volume did not increase this year specifically.\n\nC. There are groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese who have speculated in Beijing and Shanghai\nThis is not a direct argument against the given argument. The fact that there are real estate speculators among wealthy Chinese does not necessarily negate the idea that there are also more and more rich people in China who are transferring their property abroad.\n\nD. The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation\nThis is a valid argument against the given argument. If the US real estate market has been seen as a safe haven for value preservation and appreciation, it could be a reason for Chinese buyers to invest in US real estate, rather than solely due to the transfer of wealth from China.\n\nTherefore, the best argument against the given argument is option A: Many Chinese people buy homes for their children to study in the US.",

Adult locusts can survive in an environment with 2% oxygen.\nThis option does not directly support the argument, as it talks about the survival of locusts in different oxygen environments, but does not mention the size of the insects.\n\n(D) Under the environment with high oxygen content and high air pressure, the tested fruit flies lived to the fifth generation and their body size increased by 20%.\nThis option supports the argument by providing evidence that higher oxygen content in the environment can lead to an increase in the size of insects, which aligns with the key point that the amount of oxygen content can determine the size of insects.\n\nIn conclusion, both options (A) and (B) best support the given argument, as they provide evidence that the size of organisms, including insects, is related to the amount of oxygen content in their environment.",

        "output": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine which of the options can best refute the views of the scientists mentioned in the passage.\n\nThe passage states that according to many scientists, Homo sapiens, the direct ancestor of modern humans, evolved in Africa about 200,000 years ago and then slowly migrated northwards about 150,000 to 200,000 years ago, crossing the Middle East to Europe and Asia.\n\nNow, let's examine each of the given options:\n\n(A) Modern Homo sapiens, living in the late Paleolithic period, about 40,000 to 10,000 years ago. There are hundreds of places where late Homo sapiens fossils or cultural sites have been found in our country.\nThis option does not refute the views of the scientists, as it simply describes the presence of Homo sapiens fossils or cultural sites in the late Paleolithic period, which is after the timeframe mentioned in the passage.\n\n(B) In an archaeological excavation in South America, people discovered the fossils of Homo sapiens skulls that lived about 170,000 years ago.\nThis option is the best choice to refute the views of the scientists, as it provides evidence of Homo sapiens fossils found in South America that predate the 200,000-year timeline mentioned in the passage. This suggests that Homo sapiens may have originated or migrated to regions outside of Africa earlier than the scientists' belief.\n\n(C) Homo sapiens have the extraordinary ability to communicate with each other, make plans, and solve difficult problems.\nThis option does not directly refute the views of the scientists, as it simply describes a characteristic of Homo sapiens, which is not relevant to the timeline or origin of the species.\n\n(D) Eight Homo sapiens teeth 400,000 years ago were discovered in the Qesem cave 12 km east of Tel Aviv, Israel.\nThis option also refutes the views of the scientists, as it provides evidence of Homo sapiens fossils found in the Middle East that are much older (400,000 years ago) than the 200,000-year timeline mentioned in the passage. This suggests that Homo sapiens may have originated or migrated to regions outside of Africa even earlier than the scientists' belief.\n\nIn conclusion, the best option to refute the views of the scientists is (B), as it provides evidence of Homo sapiens fossils found in South America that predate the 200,000-year timeline mentioned in the passage.",

While this is a valid historical fact, it does not directly refute the supporters' argument about the potential ecological benefits of resurrecting these animals.\n\nTherefore, the option that best refutes the arguments of the above supporters is (C), as it directly challenges the assumption that the resurrected animals will have a suitable environment for their survival and the restoration of the damaged ecosystem.",
        "question": "With the help of animal fossils and DNA retained in specimens, and using increasingly advanced cloning and genetic techniques, humans have been able to \"resurrect\" some already extinct animals, such as mammoths, dodos, dinosaurs, etc.At the same time, the scientific community also started a big discussion about whether humans should revive extinct animals.Supporters believe that reanimated animals are expected to restore the damaged ecological environment in some areas.For example, Mammoths live on the vast grasslands of Siberia, and their excrement is an excellent fertilizer to nourish the grasslands.After the mammoth became extinct, grasslands lacking fertilizer were gradually replaced by tundra.If the mammoth can be resurrected and returned to Siberia, it will help reduce the area of \u200b\u200btundra and gradually restore the grassland ecosystem.\nWhich of the following, if true, would best refute the arguments of the above supporters?\n(A)If you invest a lot of time, energy and cost to resurrect the disappeared creatures, it will inevitably contain and weaken the protection of existing endangered animals, and the result will not be worth the loss.\n(B)Merely cloning an individual of an extinct animal does not mean that humans have the ability to resurrect the entire population\n(C)Even if the extinct animals can be resurrected in batches, the habitat suitable for their growth may have long since disappeared.If you can not give heavy organisms a suitable environment for survival, all efforts will be in vain\n(D)The vast majority of these animals gradually disappeared in the course of human development.It was human activities that led to their extinction",

S Institute can use weapons from other sources for weapons research.\nThis option is also correct. The Peace Foundation's conclusion assumes that the S Institute will not use the funding for weapons research, but it ignores the possibility that the institute may use funding or resources from other sources for weapons research, which would still undermine the Peace Foundation's goal of preventing weapons research.\n\n(C) Ignored this possibility? the funding of the Peace Foundation enabled S Research to have all the ability to switch other funds to weapons research.\nThis option is also correct. The Peace Foundation's conclusion does not consider the possibility that the funding provided by the foundation may free up other funds that the S Institute can then use for weapons research, effectively undermining the purpose of the funding.\n\n(D) Ignore this possibility? weapons research does not necessarily endanger peace.\nThis option is not correct. The given information clearly states that the Peace Foundation's decision was based on the concern that the funding may be used for weapons research, which they believe can endanger peace. The Peace Foundation's conclusion is based on the assumption that preventing weapons research is necessary for maintaining peace.\n\nIn summary, the most appropriate summary of the loopholes in the Peace Foundation's conclusions is a combination of options (A), (B), and (C), as they all identify potential issues that the Peace Foundation has ignored or failed to consider in its decision-making process.",

All the funding of the Peace Foundation will not be used for any weapon-related research.As a result, the Peace Foundation withdrew the above decision and reached a conclusion; as long as the S Institute kept its promise, the above funding of the Peace Foundation would no longer benefit weapons research.\nWhich of the following most appropriately summarizes the loopholes in the conclusions of the Peace Foundation?\n(A)Ignore this possibility? S Institute does not keep its promises.\n(B)Ignore this possibility? S Institute can use weapons from other sources for weapons research.\n(C)Ignored this possibility? the funding of the Peace Foundation enabled S Research to have all the ability to switch other funds to weapons research.\n(D)Ignore this possibility? weapons research does not necessarily endanger peace.",

This is a flawed argument, and the correct answer will point out the loophole in the reasoning.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) Assume without explanation?

The argument is focused on the proportion of cars with airbags in car accidents, not the likelihood of accidents.\n\n(B) Ignore this possibility?

The argument does not mention anything about the driving behavior of car owners with or without airbags.\n\n(C) Improper assumption? In any car accident, the airbag will automatically open.\nThis option is the most appropriate one. The argument assumes that the mere presence of an airbag in a car automatically makes the car owner safer. However, this is an improper assumption. The airbag may not always deploy correctly or effectively in every car accident, and its effectiveness can depend on various factors, such as the force of the impact, the position of the occupant, and the specific design of the airbag system.\n\n(D) Improperly equate the possibility of a car accident with the seriousness of the car owner's injury in the accident.\nThis option is not correct.

This explanation implies that sea otters can use this tasting behavior to avoid areas contaminated with red tide toxins.\n\nLet's evaluate each of the provided options:\n\n(A) In some sea areas where red tides appear, there are no clams or sea otters.\nThis option would not strongly indicate that the explanation is incorrect.

The explanation focuses on the ability of sea otters to detect the presence of toxins, not on the specific effects of the toxins on sea otters. Therefore, this option does not strongly indicate that the explanation is incorrect.\n\n(C) When a piece of seawater affected by the red tide was artificially dyed brown-red, the sea otters did not eat the clams in those places.\nThis option would most strongly indicate that the explanation is incorrect. If the sea otters avoided the clams in areas where the seawater was artificially dyed to mimic the red tide, but there were no actual toxins present, it would suggest that the sea otters' behavior is not solely based on their ability to detect the presence of toxins through tasting the clams.

        "output": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the logical flaws or defects in the given arguments.\n\nLet's analyze the original argument:\n\n\"The hurricane that threatened the continental United States was triggered by the high pressure on the west coast of Africa. Whenever there is heavy rainfall in the area south of the Sahara Desert, the continental United States will be hit by a particularly frequent hurricane. Therefore, a large amount of rainfall must be the cause of the hurricane that increases the pressure of the airflow.\"\n\nThe key defects in this argument are:\n\n1. Correlation does not imply causation: Just because heavy rainfall in the area south of the Sahara Desert is associated with frequent hurricanes in the continental United States, it does not necessarily mean that the rainfall is the cause of the hurricanes.\n\n2. Overgeneralization: The argument assumes that \"whenever\" there is heavy rainfall in a specific area, the continental United States will be hit by a \"particularly frequent\" hurricane. This is an overgeneralization that may not always be true.\n\n3. Lack of consideration of other factors: The argument fails to consider other potential factors that may contribute to the formation of hurricanes, such as ocean temperatures, wind patterns, or atmospheric conditions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) \"Cars drive faster on long streets than on short streets, so pedestrians on long streets are more dangerous than pedestrians on short streets.\"\nThis argument contains a similar defect to the original argument, as it assumes that the speed of cars on a street is the only factor that determines the danger to pedestrians, ignoring other factors such as traffic density, visibility, and pedestrian behavior.\n\n(B) \"Many people who later become entrepreneurs often participate in competitive sports when they are in college. Therefore, participation in competitive sports must promote the ability to make people entrepreneurs.\"\nThis argument also suffers from the correlation-causation fallacy, as it assumes that participation in competitive sports is the cause of entrepreneurial ability, without considering other potential factors that may contribute to both.\n\n(C) \"The petals of mulberry chrysanthemum will be closed at noon, so the petals of mulberry chrysanthemum will definitely open at night.\"\nThis argument contains a logical leap, as it assumes that the petals being closed at noon implies that they will open at night, without providing a clear logical connection between the two events.\n\n(D) \"The events in Eastern Europe will affect the political situation in Central America, so the liberalization of Eastern Europe will lead to the liberalization of Central America.\"\nThis argument is similar to the original argument in that it assumes a direct causal relationship between events in one region and the effects on another region, without considering the complexity of political and social dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the argument that most closely resembles the defects in the original argument is option (D).",

However, the statement also says that most people consume more food while increasing the number of meals.\n\n3.

Now, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) \"For most people, his daily food intake does not significantly affect his cholesterol level.\"\nThis option is not supported by the statement, as it suggests that the amount of food consumed does not affect cholesterol levels, which contradicts the original statement.\n\n(B) \"For most people, increasing the number of meals a day will not result in a significant reduction in cholesterol levels.\"\nThis option is the most strongly supported by the statement. The statement indicates that for most people, increasing the number of meals does not lead to a decrease in cholesterol levels, as they end up consuming more food overall.\n\n(C) \"For most people, the amount of food eaten per day will not be affected by the number of foods eaten per day.\"\nThis option is not supported by the statement. The statement suggests that for most people, increasing the number of meals leads to an increase in the total amount of food consumed per day.\n\n(D) \"For most people, the amount of food consumed is greatly affected by the time taken to eat.\"\nThis option is not directly supported by the statement. The statement does not mention anything about the time taken to eat and how it affects the amount of food consumed.\n\nTherefore, the option that is most strongly supported by the given statement is (B) \"For most people, increasing the number of meals a day will not result in a significant reduction in cholesterol levels.\"",

        "output": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine which of the options best explains the outflow of the 100 billion yuan savings funds.\n\nGiven information:\n- In the first half of 2004, the price increase in China exceeded the interest rate of bank deposits.\n- From January to July, residents' income continued to increase, but the growth rate of residents' savings deposits continued to decline.\n- Outflow deposits in July reached about 100 billion yuan, and the proportion of time deposits in all deposits continued to decline.\n\nStep 1: Understand the characteristics of capital and the pursuit of profit.\nThe characteristic of capital is the pursuit of profit. This means that capital will flow to where it can generate the highest returns or profits.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options and determine which one best explains the outflow of the 100 billion yuan savings funds.\n\nOption A: As the expected price continues to rise, many residents' funds can only survive, so that they can buy the goods they need at any time.\nThis option suggests that residents may have withdrawn their savings to buy goods, as they anticipate further price increases. This could be a plausible explanation for the outflow of funds, as residents seek to maintain their purchasing power.\n\nOption B: Due to the expected increase in bank interest rates, many residents' funds can only survive for a period of time.\nThis option suggests that residents may have withdrawn their savings in anticipation of higher bank interest rates in the future. This would not be the best explanation, as the given information indicates that the price increase in China exceeded the interest rate of bank deposits, which means that the interest rates were not expected to increase significantly.\n\nOption C: As the state controls the scale of loans, the funds of the majority of private enterprises are tight, and private lending is active. The interest on lending has been much higher than the bank deposit interest rate.\nThis option provides the best explanation for the outflow of the 100 billion yuan savings funds. If private lending offered higher interest rates than bank deposits, it would be more profitable for residents to lend their funds to private enterprises rather than keep them in bank deposits. This would lead to the observed outflow of savings funds.\n\nOption D: Because bank deposit interest rates are too low, many residents consider whether to buy stocks or funds.\nThis option is not the best explanation, as it suggests that residents may have withdrawn their savings to invest in stocks or funds, which is not directly related to the pursuit of profit through private lending.\n\nTherefore, the option that best explains the flow of most of the 100 billion yuan savings funds is Option C.",

Specifically, it states that if a person only lives for one day, it would be best for them to steal from others because they would not have to fear being caught. However, for someone who can live for 20 years, stealing would not be the best choice because they would have to live with the fear of being caught.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n(A) Only by suffering from the fear of being caught will you not steal things from others.\nThis statement supports the argument presented in the problem, as it suggests that the fear of being caught is the primary deterrent for stealing.

It suggests that the length of a person's life is not the only factor that determines whether they will engage in good or bad behavior.

However, with the rapid economic development, it has become a hindrance to the passage of giant ships. A bridge expert has asserted that the bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given options\n(A) Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.\nThis option suggests that the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge has created a logistics problem, where goods have to be transported by road or rail instead of water. This could raise doubts about the necessity of demolishing and rebuilding the bridge, as it may still be serving a significant purpose in the transportation of goods.\n\n(B) 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.\nThis option indicates that the majority of international ships do not need to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, as they are moored at ports below the bridge. This could suggest that the bridge is not a significant hindrance to the passage of large ships, and therefore, the need to demolish and rebuild it may not be as urgent as the expert claims.\n\n(C) It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge. The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.\nThis option suggests that the Nanjing Bridge is not the only obstacle to the passage of large ships on the Yangtze River. There are other bridges with a similar clear height, which would also need to be addressed if the goal is to dredge the golden waterways. This could raise doubts about the expert's focus on the Nanjing Bridge alone and the feasibility of the proposed solution.\n\n(D) Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.\nThis option indicates that there are already ships designed to navigate the Yangtze River, including the section where the Nanjing Bridge is located. This could suggest that the bridge is not necessarily a major obstacle, and the passage of large ships may be possible with the current technology, thereby casting doubt on the necessity of demolishing and rebuilding the bridge.\n\nStep 3: Determine the most doubts-raising option\nBased on the analysis, option (B) appears to raise the most doubts about the expert's point of view. The fact that the majority of international ships do not need to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, as they are moored at ports below the bridge, suggests that the bridge may not be a significant hindrance to the passage of large ships.

They have tossed the coin 6 times, and all 6 times, it has landed upside down. The person believes that the next few tosses must be heads up, and they will definitely win back their losses.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the reasoning\n(A) It makes sense, because God is fair and almost equal, he does not return bad luck.\nThis option is incorrect because the probability of a coin landing on heads or tails is not affected by any external factors, such as \"God's fairness.\" Each coin toss is an independent event.\n\n(B) It doesn't make sense, because each throw is an independent event and has nothing to do with the previous results.\nThis option is correct.

This would contradict the claim that seals are unlikely to have caused the significant decline in cod.\n\n(B) The damage caused by seawater pollution to cod is more serious than that caused to seals.\nThis statement does not weaken the argument. It simply suggests that factors other than the increase in seal population, such as seawater pollution, may have contributed to the decline in cod. However, it does not directly address the relationship between seals and cod.\n\n(C) Before the number of seals increased, the number of cod in the North Atlantic Ocean was greatly reduced.\nThis statement can weaken the argument because it suggests that the decline in cod numbers occurred before the increase in seal population.

        "question": "Recently, the eight major ministries and commissions such as the State Administration of Press and Publication jointly announced that the \"Online Game Anti-Addiction System\" and the accompanying \"Online Game Anti-Addiction System Real-Name Authentication Scheme\" will be officially implemented this year.Hours, experience value and income will be counted as 0.The implementation of this program will effectively prevent minors from indulging in online games.\nWhich of the following statements, if correct, can weaken the above conclusion most effectively?\n(A)Many minors only play online games occasionally.\u2018\u2018 Internet game anti-addiction system \u2019has no effect on them.\n(B)\"Online game anti-addiction system\" does not work for adults, and minors may use adult identity or use some online tools to generate fake ID numbers to log in to online games.\n(C)The introduction of the \"Online Game Anti-Addiction System\" means that minors are allowed to play online games with the permission of the competent department, so that they can go from secret to public.\n(D)In addition to online games, there are stand-alone games and PS games played on TV sets.\u2018\u2018 Online game anti-addiction system \u2019may cause many underage players to switch to these games.",
        "answer_check": "No@\nThe student's solution is incorrect. The correct answer is option (B), which suggests that minors may use adult identities or generate fake ID numbers to circumvent the system, making it ineffective in preventing them from indulging in online games. The student chose option (D), which is a weaker argument, as it only suggests that minors may switch to other forms of gaming, but does not directly challenge the effectiveness of the \"Online Game Anti-Addiction System\" in preventing online gaming addiction."

This statement can strengthen Zhang Tao's objection that the country does not yet have the conditions to levy the inheritance tax.\n\n(B) At present in our country, both civilians and millionaires want to leave their wealth to their children and grandchildren.\nThis statement supports Li Ming's argument that the levy of inheritance tax has a solid real economic foundation, as there is a desire among the wealthy and the general population to pass on their wealth to their descendants. This statement does not strengthen Zhang Tao's objection and is, therefore, not the best choice.\n\n(C) The inheritance tax can only be implemented if the personal information is clear.\nThis statement suggests that the implementation of the inheritance tax requires clear personal information, which may not be the case in the country. This can be a potential obstacle to the implementation of the inheritance tax, strengthening Zhang Tao's objection that the country does not yet have the conditions to levy the inheritance tax.\n\n(D) Some wealthy film and television stars in our country died unfortunately before the age of 60.\nThis statement suggests that some wealthy individuals in the country may not have the opportunity to pass on their wealth to their descendants due to their untimely deaths. This can be seen as an exception to the general trend of wealth transfer, and it does not directly strengthen Zhang Tao's objection that the country does not have the conditions to levy the inheritance tax.\n\nTherefore, the best statement to strengthen Zhang Tao's objection is (A), as it suggests that the wealth transfer to the next generation may not happen in the immediate future, which would not provide a solid real economic foundation for the implementation of the inheritance tax.",

It cites examples of other countries like South Korea, Spain, and Greece experiencing economic decline after the Olympics. The argument then concludes that China will also experience an economic recession after the 2008 Olympic Games.\n\n2. Identify the key premise:\nThe key premise of the argument is that the economic factors that boost the host country's economy during the Olympics disappear after the games, leading to a recession.\n\n3.

The argument states that pollution problems caused by garbage exudates are most severe in countries with a per capita output value between US$4,000 and US$5,000 per year, and relatively poor or wealthy countries are not as severe.\n\n2. The argument further states that at the initial stage of industrial development, the pollution problem is relatively serious, but when industrial development can create enough means to deal with such problems, the pollution problem will be reduced.\n\n3. The argument then states that the per capita output value of Country X is $5,000 per year, and in the next few years, pollution caused by garbage exudates in Country X will gradually decrease.\n\nThe key to identifying the assumption is to understand the causal relationship between the per capita output value and the pollution problem.\n\nThe argument suggests that as a country's industrial development progresses, it will be able to create the necessary means to deal with pollution problems. Therefore, the assumption underlying the argument is that the industrial development of Country X will continue to grow in the next few years.\n\nThe correct statement that reflects this assumption is:\n\n(C) In the next few years, the industrial development of country X will grow.\n\nThis assumption is necessary for the argument to conclude that the pollution problem in Country X will gradually decrease in the next few years.",

However, it provides two examples where these actions had unintended consequences:\n1. In 1990, the Japanese government increased the discount rate to suppress stock market and real estate bubbles, which ultimately led to deflation and a decade of economic stagnation.\n2. From 1995 to 1996, the Central Bank of Thailand continued to tighten the monetary policy to suppress asset price bubbles, which led to a major economic recession.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the possible conclusions.\n(A) Increasing bank deposit interest rates can suppress inflation.\nThis statement is not a suitable conclusion based on the information provided in the passage. The passage does not discuss the direct relationship between increasing bank deposit interest rates and suppressing inflation.\n\n(B) Tight monetary policy may lead to economic decline.\nThis statement is the most suitable conclusion based on the evidence presented in the passage. The passage clearly demonstrates that the tight monetary policies adopted by the Japanese and Thai governments resulted in economic decline, rather than the intended outcomes of suppressing asset price bubbles.\n\n(C) Economic development is cyclical.\nWhile the passage suggests that the consequences of tight monetary policies can lead to economic decline, it does not provide enough information to conclude that economic development is inherently cyclical. The passage focuses on specific instances and does not address the broader concept of economic development cycles.\n\n(D) Using monetary policy can control economic development.\nThis statement is not supported by the evidence in the passage. The passage shows that the use of tight monetary policies by the Japanese and Thai governments had unintended negative consequences, suggesting that monetary policy may not always be effective in controlling economic development.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable conclusion based on the information provided in the passage is option (B): Tight monetary policy may lead to economic decline.",

The results showed a lower germination rate in the room with a WiFi transmitter compared to the room without one.\n\nMany experts believe that this experiment is not rigorous enough to conclude that WiFi radiation is harmful to humans. Let's evaluate the given assertions to determine which one(s) can support the experts' opinions.\n\n(A) The impact of WiFi radiation on the human body is related not only to its frequency, but also to the distance between the WiFi transmitter and the human body.\nThis assertion is valid and supports the experts' opinion. The impact of electromagnetic radiation, including WiFi radiation, on living organisms depends on various factors, such as the frequency and the distance from the source. This suggests that the results of the experiment with cress seeds may not directly translate to the effects on human health, as the conditions in the experiment may not accurately represent the real-life exposure to WiFi radiation.\n\n(B) Keep other conditions unchanged in the same room, and repeat the experiment with and without a WiFi transmitter.\nThis assertion is also valid and supports the experts' opinion. The experts suggest that the experiment conducted by the Danish middle school students may not have adequately controlled for other factors that could affect the germination of the cress seeds. Repeating the experiment in the same room, with all other conditions unchanged, would help to isolate the effect of the WiFi transmitter and strengthen the conclusions drawn from the experiment.\n\n(C) There are many factors that affect the germination of seeds, and experiments by Danish middle school students cannot exclude the interference of other factors.\nThis assertion is correct and supports the experts' opinion. The germination of seeds can be influenced by various factors, such as temperature, humidity, soil composition, and other environmental conditions. The experiment conducted by the Danish middle school students may not have accounted for all the possible confounding factors, which could have influenced the observed differences in germination rates.\n\n(D) Animal experiments should be done to determine the effects of WiFi radiation on the human body, not just plant experiments.\nThis assertion is valid and supports the experts' opinion. While the experiment with cress seeds provides some insights, it may not accurately reflect the potential effects of WiFi radiation on human health. Animal experiments would be a more appropriate approach to investigate the impact of WiFi radiation on living organisms that are more closely related to humans, as they can better simulate the complex physiological responses in the human body.\n\nIn summary, the assertions that can support the experts' opinions are (A), (B), (C), and (D).",

The text discusses the long-standing practice of enrolling master's and doctoral students in writing programs in the United States, Canada, and other countries.\n\n2. It suggests that there is a \"very different attitude towards applied and technical disciplines\" compared to writing degrees.\n\n3. The text then asks whether this attitude is right or wrong.\n\n4. To determine the rationality of this argument, the key issue to address is whether the institutions have the necessary qualifications and research capabilities in the field of writing to offer master's and doctoral degrees.\n\n5. Option (A) is less relevant, as the number of applicants for a writing program does not directly address the core issue of the argument, which is about the institutions' capabilities to deliver such programs.\n\n6.

Fluctuations in food prices due to bad weather can make it more difficult for people to access and afford food, which can worsen the problem of hunger, even if food waste is eliminated.\n\n(B) Today's agricultural development level has been able to protect the world's people from hunger from a total amount:\nThis option is not an appropriate challenge to the conclusion. If the world's agricultural development has been able to protect people from hunger, it would strengthen the argument that eliminating food waste could save millions of lives, as there would be enough food available.\n\n(C) Consumption can promote economic development, and one way for the rich to help the poor is to increase waste:\nThis option is not a valid challenge to the conclusion. Encouraging waste as a means to promote economic development or help the poor is counterintuitive and contradicts the idea of eliminating food waste to save lives.\n\n(D) Eliminating food waste is only a favorable condition to solve the problem of hunger:\nThis option is the most appropriate challenge to the conclusion. It correctly suggests that eliminating food waste is only a favorable condition, not a complete solution, to the problem of hunger.

It is impossible to be aware of what happened before you.\"\n\nThe key points in this argument are:\n1. Using replay to determine penalties is wrong.\n2. This is because some foul actions will inevitably be missed, even with multiple cameras tracking the game.\n3. It is impossible to be aware of what happened before you.\n\nThe defect in this argument is that it assumes that just because some foul actions will be missed, using replay is not a valid way to determine penalties. The argument fails to consider that even though some actions may be missed, replay can still provide a more accurate and fair assessment of the events than relying solely on the on-field officials' observations.\n\nNow, let's compare this defect to the defects in the given options:\n\n(A) \"Knowledge is a virtue, because no one does it on purpose.\"\nThis argument has a logical fallacy. Just because someone doesn't do something on purpose, it doesn't mean that the action is virtuous. The argument fails to establish a clear connection between knowledge and virtue.\n\n(B) \"We should not ask the police because they cannot stop all criminal activities.\"\nThis argument has a similar defect to the given argument. It assumes that because the police cannot stop all criminal activities, we should not ask them for help. This is a flawed logic, as the inability to stop all crimes does not negate the value and importance of the police's role in addressing criminal activities.\n\n(C) \"Trial marriage is not immoral, because anyone who buys clothes can try on.\"\nThis argument has a non-sequitur defect. The fact that people can try on clothes does not logically lead to the conclusion that trial marriage is not immoral. The argument fails to establish a clear connection between the premise and the conclusion.\n\n(D) \"Faith cannot create reality, because taking something as true does not make it true.\"\nThis argument has a similar defect to the given argument. It assumes that because taking something as true does not make it true, faith cannot create reality. This is a flawed logic, as the inability to create reality does not necessarily negate the value and importance of faith.\n\nBased on the analysis, the defect in the argument that is most similar to the given argument is the one in option (B): \"We should not ask the police because they cannot stop all criminal activities.\" Both arguments make the mistake of rejecting a solution or approach solely because it cannot address the problem in its entirety.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

The high energy density and stability of the 18650 batteries may actually support the expert's assessment of the fire risk, as more energy-dense batteries can potentially pose a higher fire risk. This statement does not provide a strong counterargument.\n\n(B) Billions of 18650 batteries are produced every year in the world, and their safety level is constantly improving:\nThis statement could potentially weaken the expert's judgment. If the safety level of 18650 batteries is constantly improving, then the probability of fire may be lower than the expert's assessment, which was based on historical data. This suggests that the current fire risk may be lower than the expert's estimate.\n\n(C) TESLA has a very advanced battery management system, which will automatically disconnect the output of abnormal battery cells:\nThis statement directly weakens the expert's judgment. If TESLA's battery management system can automatically disconnect abnormal battery cells, it would reduce the risk of a fire spreading from a single cell to the entire battery pack.

The given statement suggests that arming one's mind with critical thinking can help avoid a lifetime in chaos, but it does not mean that there are only these two options. It is possible for someone to find other ways to avoid chaos without necessarily arming their mind with critical thinking.\n\n(C) People who do not want to learn to think independently and make rational decisions need not arm their minds with critical thinking.\nThis statement is true. If someone does not have the desire to learn to think independently and make rational decisions, then they would not necessarily need to arm their mind with critical thinking, as the given statement suggests that critical thinking is a means to that end.\n\n(D) Only those who are armed with critical thinking can get rid of the fate dictated by others.\nThis statement is not necessarily true.

The task is to find the statement that most strongly weakens this conclusion.\n\n(A) \"Someone loves reading literary works, especially poems, and later writes poems by himself.

It suggests that reading books of a certain type or opinion can actually make people more closed-minded and paranoid, rather than open-minded.\n\n(D) \"Some people like to put themselves in when they read. When they read \"Dream of Red Mansions\", they feel that they are Lin Daiyu or Jia Baoyu.\"\nThis statement does not weaken the conclusion.

According to the public opinion survey results, after Li Mingbo visited Dokdo, his approval rating increased from 25.7% to 34.7%.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n(A) \"There are more Koreans who support Li Mingbo's visit to Dokdo than those who do not.\"\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to compare the number of Koreans who support Li Mingbo's visit to Dokdo with the number of those who do not.\nGiven information:\n- Before the visit, Li Mingbo's approval rating was 25.7%.\n- After the visit, his approval rating increased to 34.7%.\nThis means that the number of Koreans who support Li Mingbo increased from 25.7% to 34.7%. However, we don't have information about the number of Koreans who do not support him. Therefore, we cannot determine if there are more Koreans who support the visit than those who do not. The statement is not necessarily true.\n\n(B) \"After Li Mingbo visited Dokdo, some people who did not support him now turned to support him.\"\nThis statement is true. The increase in Li Mingbo's approval rating from 25.7% to 34.7% implies that some people who did not support him previously have now turned to support him.\n\n(C) \"Koreans who supported Li Mingbo before August 10, 2012 now continue to support him.\"\nThis statement is likely true.

Belief is a matter of the heart and mind, not a matter of calculation or choice.\n\nThe other options do not fully capture the issue with Pascal's argument. Option (B) is only partially correct, as Pascal does introduce an element of self-interest calculation, but the main issue is the assumption of choice in belief. Option (C) is incorrect, as the argument does not necessarily lead to a misunderstanding of the world if God does not exist. Option (D) is not relevant to the specific argument presented.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option (A), as it accurately identifies the logical loophole in Pascal's argument, which is the incorrect assumption that belief in God is a matter of choice.",

People who want to pay taxes honestly often make mistakes in reporting because of misunderstandings.\n3. Those who deliberately avoid taxes always find loopholes in tax laws.\n4.

Most of the tax avoidance space created by complex taxes will be used by the rich, making progressive taxation less than the degree of progress required by the tax law, and its function of regulating distribution is also greatly weakened.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the provided options:\n\n(A) When filing taxes, 60% of the people in the United States need to hire professionals to report on their behalf, and 22% need to use tax reporting software to help them calculate.\nThis statement supports the argument that the tax law is extremely complicated, as a significant portion of the population needs assistance in filing their taxes. This suggests that the complexity of the tax system creates a tax avoidance space that is disproportionately utilized by the rich.\n\n(B) The Americans proposed the idea of \u200b\u200b\"abolishing the progressive tax rate and implementing a single tax rate\" in 1981.\nThis statement does not directly support the economists' argument. It simply mentions a proposal made in 1981, which is not directly relevant to the argument about the complexity of the tax system and its impact on progressive taxation.\n\n(C) From 1988 to 2006, the income of the richest one in the United States increased from 15% to 22% of the national income, but their average tax rate fell from 24% to 22.8%.\nThis statement strongly supports the economists' argument. It shows that despite the increase in the income of the richest one percent, their average tax rate decreased, suggesting that they were able to exploit the tax avoidance space created by the complex tax system, making progressive taxation less effective.\n\n(D) On September 17, 2011, the Wall Street movement broke out in the United States.

The argument suggests that cancer patients should not go to the hospital for treatment because the probability of death from a medical accident is not less than 0.3%.\n\n2. However, this argument fails to consider the potential benefits of going to the hospital for cancer treatment. Cancer patients may have a higher chance of survival if they receive proper medical care and treatment at the hospital, even with the risk of a medical accident.\n\n3.

This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the risks and benefits of seeking hospital treatment.\n\n4. If the mortality rate of cancer patients who go to the hospital is significantly lower than those who don't, then the argument against seeking hospital treatment becomes weaker. The potential benefits of receiving proper medical care may outweigh the risk of a medical accident.\n\n5.
