When Chie receives his calling card, Naomi recognizes Akira's name, indicating that Naomi is familiar with him. This suggests there is some prior understanding or relationship between Akira and Naomi.\n\n3. Akira addresses Chie formally and respectfully, referring to her as \"Madame\" and apologizing for the \"disruption\". This shows he is treating her with deference and respect.\n\n4. Akira directly states his purpose - to ask for Naomi's hand in marriage. This is a bold and unconventional move, breaking with traditional customs. However, Akira explains that he is doing this to save time, as the use of a go-between would take much longer.\n\n5. Chie is taken aback by Akira's direct proposal, indicating that his approach is out of the ordinary. But Akira remains composed and courteous, even offering to reapproach Chie in two weeks if she needs more time.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is (D) respect but not utter deference. Akira shows respect and courtesy towards Chie, but his direct approach is not one of complete deference to tradition and custom.",

        "solve_prompt": "Solve the following task. Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nThe chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is now well established. The molecule is a very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a  regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which can be of four different types. Two of the possible bases-adenine and guanine - are purines, and the other two-thymine and cytosine-are pyrimidines. So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the 10 chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of phosphate, sugar and base, is known as a nucleotide.The first feature of our structure which is of biological interest is that it consists not of one chain, but of two. These two chains are both coiled around15 a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that since there was only one chain in the chemical formula there would only be one in the structural unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two.The other biologically important feature is the manner in which the two chains are held together. This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases. The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single25 base from the other. The important point is that only certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure.One member of a pair must be a purine and the other a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for 30 example, there would not be room for it.We believe that the bases will be present almost entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true, the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are: 35 adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine. Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but when it does, its partner on the other chain must always be thymine.The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is 40 completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of bases can fit into the structure. It follows that in a long molecule many different permutations are possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise sequence of bases is the code which carries the45 genetical information. If the actual order of the bases on one of the pair of chains were given, one could write down the exact order of the bases on the other one, because of the specific pairing.

Thus one chain is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is50 this feature which suggests how the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule might duplicate itself.The table shows, for various organisms, the percentage of each of the four types of nitrogenous bases in that organism's DNA.\\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\\hline\\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Base Composition of DNA} \\\\\\hline\\multirow{3}{*}{Organism} & \\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{$\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Percentage of base } \\\\\\text { in organism's DNA }\\end{array}$} \\\\\\cline { 2 - 5 }& $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { adenine } \\\\ (\\%)\\end{array}$ & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { guanine } \\\\ (\\%)\\end{array}$ & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { cytosine } \\\\ (\\%)\\end{array}$ & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { thymine } \\\\ (\\%)\\end{array}$ \\\\\\hline& 26.8 & 22.8 & 23.2 & 27.2 \\\\\\hlineOctopus & 33.2 & 17.6 & 17.6 & 31.6 \\\\\\hlineChicken & 28.0 & 22.0 & 21.6 & 28.4 \\\\\\hlineRat & 28.6 & 21.4 & 20.5 & 28.4 \\\\\\hlineHuman & 29.3 & 20.7 & 20.0 & 30.0 \\\\\\hlineGrasshopper & 29.3 & 20.5 & 20.7 & 29.3 \\\\\\hlineSea urchin & 32.8 & 17.7 & 17.3 & 32.1 \\\\\\hlineWheat & 27.3 & 22.7 & 22.8 & 27.1 \\\\\\hlineYeast & 31.3 & 18.7 & 17.1 & 32.9 \\\\\\hlineE. coli & 24.7 & 26.0 & 25.7 & 23.6 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}\nAccording to the table, which of the following pairs of base percentages in sea urchin DNA provides evidence in support of the answer to the previous question?\n(A)$17.3 \\%$ and $17.7 \\%$\n(B)$17.3 \\%$ and $32.1 \\%$\n(C)$17.3 \\%$ and $32.8 \\%$\n(D)$17.7 \\%$ and $32.8 \\%$",

The passage begins by describing a scene on a bridge over the River Thames, where the narrator can observe the \"procession of the sons of educated men\" - people who have been educated at public schools and universities and are now taking up various professions.\n\n2. The narrator notes that this is no longer just a sight to observe, but something that the narrator is now part of, as \"we too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice.\"\n\n3. The narrator then poses a series of important questions that need to be answered about this \"procession of educated men\" - \"Do we wish to join that procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men?\"\n\n4. The narrator stresses the urgency of these questions, noting that \"The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer.\"\n\n5. The narrator pushes back against excuses for not having time to think about these questions, arguing that \"the daughters of educated men have always done their thinking from hand to mouth\" and that \"It falls to us now to go on thinking\" about these important issues.\n\nBased on this analysis, the main purpose of the passage appears to be (B) to stress the urgency of an issue.

That's the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on mining beyond Earth.Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for 5 Space Engineering Research, the event brought together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar scientists, and government agencies that are all working to make space mining a reality.The forum comes hot on the heels of the 102012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms. Planetary Resources of Washington says it will launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years, while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020 . Another15 commercial venture that sprung up in 2012, Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to the moon, including to potential lunar miners.Within a few decades, these firms may be meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as20 platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital for personal electronics, such as yttrium and lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who transformed the western United States, the first space miners won't just enrich themselves. They also hope25 to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds with Earth, in which the materials extracted and processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered for space-based projects.In this scenario, water mined from other 30 worlds could become the most desired commodity. \"In the desert, what's worth more: a kilogram of gold or a kilogram of water?\" asks Kris Zacny of HoneyBee Robotics in New York. \"Gold is useless. Water will let you live.\"35 Water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield.

She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, \"We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been,\" and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a \"fruitful intermission\" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 \"And can you guess what we saw from the train?\" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. \"Camels!\" she said. \"We saw a whole caravan of camels.\" She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up.\"She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem,\" Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, \"That's right.\"1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.\nThe narrator of the passage can best be described as\n(A)one of Miss Spivey's former students.\n(B)Miss Spivey's predecessor.\n(C)an anonymous member of the community.\n(D)Miss Spivey herself. 2\n",

They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 \"And can you guess what we saw from the train?\" Miss Spivey asked.

        "solve_prompt": "Solve the following task. Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nIn the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 H\u00e5kan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues \u00c5ke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these \"low-threshold\" nerves \"C-tactile,\" or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their \"exquisite sensitivity\" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \\mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing.

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nIn the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 H\u00e5kan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues \u00c5ke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these \"low-threshold\" nerves \"C-tactile,\" or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their \"exquisite sensitivity\" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \\mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations\nWhich conclusion is best supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment?\n(A)Stimulation at bodily extremities can be sensed as rapidly as stimulation closer to the brain.\n(B)The presence of hairs in human skin lessens the speed with which nerves conduct signals.\n(C)Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.\n(D)The speed at which a nerve fires is dependent on the strength of pressure applied to the nerve.\n",

This supports the conclusion that gentle pressure is sensed by both fast and slow nerve fibers.\n\nThe other options are not as well supported:\n\n(A) is not supported, as the experiment did not examine the speed of signal transmission at different body locations.\n(B) is not supported, as the presence of hairs in the skin was not discussed as a factor affecting nerve conduction speed.\n(D) is not supported, as the experiment did not examine how nerve firing speed varies with the strength of pressure applied.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion best supported by the 1993 experiment findings is (C) - that gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.",

Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 H\u00e5kan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues \u00c5ke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these \"low-threshold\" nerves \"C-tactile,\" or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their \"exquisite sensitivity\" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \\mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations\nAccording to the passage, humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when\n(A)brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals.\n(B)CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus.\n(C)nerve fibers that sense pain are suppressed.\n(D)conscious aspects of sensation are ignored.\n",

        "solve_prompt": "Solve the following task. Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nMany millennia before the invention of herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a  valuable part of an integrated weed-management 5 program. Although plowing kills standing weeds, farmers have long known that it often leads to the emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.Ecologists have shown that a farmer's field can have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter 10 buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists have shown that seeds buried more than about one centimeter below the soil surface do not receive enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow, which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil15 surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by exposure to sunlight?Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a 20 relatively simple experiment, they went to ten different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then25 exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples, weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a \"light break,\" and this stimulates their 30 germination.More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany reasoned that when farmers plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is35 turned over, and that this stimulates their germination. Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if40 farmers simply plowed their fields during the night, when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which photons hit the surface] is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. Although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike 45 each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when he first came up with this idea because he assumed 50 that such a simple method of weed control as plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated 55 that the method can be effective.Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip60 at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas 65 only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.This method of weed control is currently being used by several farmers in Germany. Because many of the same weed species that invade farmers' fields70 in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world, this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact, recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon, Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina support this idea.

Plant physiologists have shown that seeds buried more than about one centimeter below the soil surface do not receive enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow, which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil15 surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by exposure to sunlight?Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a 20 relatively simple experiment, they went to ten different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then25 exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples, weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a \"light break,\" and this stimulates their 30 germination.More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany reasoned that when farmers plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is35 turned over, and that this stimulates their germination. Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if40 farmers simply plowed their fields during the night, when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which photons hit the surface] is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. Although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike 45 each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when he first came up with this idea because he assumed 50 that such a simple method of weed control as plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated 55 that the method can be effective.Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip60 at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas 65 only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.This method of weed control is currently being used by several farmers in Germany. Because many of the same weed species that invade farmers' fields70 in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world, this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact, recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon, Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina support this idea.

They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a \"light break,\" and this stimulates their 30 germination.More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany reasoned that when farmers plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is35 turned over, and that this stimulates their germination. Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if40 farmers simply plowed their fields during the night, when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which photons hit the surface] is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. Although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike 45 each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when he first came up with this idea because he assumed 50 that such a simple method of weed control as plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated 55 that the method can be effective.Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip60 at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas 65 only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.This method of weed control is currently being used by several farmers in Germany. Because many of the same weed species that invade farmers' fields70 in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world, this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact, recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon, Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina support this idea.

So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. \"He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!\" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. \"I asked 35 him how it went,\" Ken recalled, \"and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' \" Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the \"aha\" moment. \"The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively,\" he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. \"It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car,\" he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)\nWhich choice best reflects the overall sequence of events in the passage?\n(A)An experiment is proposed but proves unworkable; a less ambitious experiment is attempted, and it yields data that give rise to a new set of questions.\n(B)A new discovery leads to reconsideration of a theory; a classic study is adapted, and the results are summarized.\n(C)An anomaly is observed and simulated experimentally; the results are compared with previous findings, and a novel hypothesis is proposed.\n(D)An unexpected finding arises during the early phase of a study; the study is modified in response to this finding, and the results are interpreted and evaluated.\n",

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\n\\section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice.

Understand the passage: Passage 1 presents the argument that women should be excluded from political rights and functions because their \"delicate constitutions,\" \"peaceful inclinations,\" and \"duties of motherhood\" make them better suited for \"gentle occupations and the cares of the home.\" The authors argue that this division of roles between the sexes is a \"great conserving principle\" of society.\n\n2. Identify the key point: The key point of Passage 1 is that the authors believe women's roles in the household and as mothers are more valuable to society than any potential political or public roles they could have.\n\n3. Evaluate the answer choices:\n(A) is incorrect because Passage 1 does not suggest that household and child-rearing roles are rewarding for both men and women. It specifically argues that these roles are better suited for women.\n(B) is correct. Passage 1 suggests that the authors believe the roles performed by women in the household and as mothers yield less value for society than the roles performed by men.\n(C) is incorrect because Passage 1 does not claim that household and child-rearing activities are easy or without difficulty.\n(D) is incorrect because Passage 1 argues that the skills required for household and child-rearing roles are distinct from those needed to run a country or business.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",

These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\\hline& \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\\\\text { pathogen }\\end{array}$} \\\\\\hlinePathogen & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Colonies with } \\\\ \\text { colony collapse } \\\\ \\text { disorder (\\%) }\\end{array}$ & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Colonies without } \\\\ \\text { colony collapse } \\\\ \\text { disorder (\\%) }\\end{array}$ \\\\\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\\\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\\\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\\\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\\\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\\\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\\hline& \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\\\\text { pathogen }\\end{array}$} \\\\\\hlinePathogen & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Colonies with } \\\\ \\text { colony collapse } \\\\ \\text { disorder (\\%) }\\end{array}$ & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Colonies without } \\\\ \\text { colony collapse } \\\\ \\text { disorder (\\%) }\\end{array}$ \\\\\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\\\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\\\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\\\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\\\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\\\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

The authors claim that varroa mites can increase a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections with fungi, bacteria, or viruses.\n\n2. The table provided shows the percent of colonies affected by various pathogens, including viruses (IAPV and KBV) and fungi (Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae), in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.\n\n3. The key information to look for is whether the percent of colonies affected by these pathogens is higher in colonies with colony collapse disorder compared to colonies without.\n\n4. Analyzing the data in the table:\n   - For viruses, the percent of colonies affected is higher in colonies with colony collapse disorder (100% for IAPV, 90% for KBV) compared to colonies without (76% for IAPV, 48% for KBV).\n   - For fungi, the percent of colonies affected is also higher in colonies with colony collapse disorder (100% for both Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae) compared to colonies without (0% for Nosema apis, \"All four pathogens\" for Nosema ceranae).\n\n5. Based on this analysis, the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections. The higher percentages of colonies affected by viruses and fungi in colonies with colony collapse disorder suggest that the presence of mites may have contributed to increased susceptibility to these pathogens.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.",
        "question": "Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\\hline& \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\\\\text { pathogen }\\end{array}$} \\\\\\hlinePathogen & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Colonies with } \\\\ \\text { colony collapse } \\\\ \\text { disorder (\\%) }\\end{array}$ & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Colonies without } \\\\ \\text { colony collapse } \\\\ \\text { disorder (\\%) }\\end{array}$ \\\\\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\\\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\\\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\\\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\\\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\\\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the \"physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature.\" To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do.

He argues that women have a \"subordinate station\" to men, but that this is not because their duties or influence should be any less important. \n\n2. Beecher says that women should exert their influence through \"peace and love\" rather than through \"collision of intellect\" or \"physical force\" like men. Their power should come from making themselves \"respected, esteemed and loved\" so that men willingly follow their opinions.\n\n3. Beecher states that this influence of women should be confined to the \"domestic and social circle\" rather than in public, political spheres.\n\n4. Based on this, the correct answer is (B) - Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is indirect, because they exert their influence within the home and family life, rather than through direct political action.\n\nThe passage does not support the other answer choices:\n(A) is incorrect because Beecher does not say women's thoughts on politics are overlooked, but rather that their influence should be confined to the domestic sphere.\n(C) is incorrect because Beecher acknowledges women's influence, just in a different sphere than men.\n(D) is incorrect because Beecher does not characterize women as more idealistic about politics than men.",

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passages, there is no evidence that both authors would agree with this claim.\n\n(C) The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.\nThis claim is supported by the arguments in Passage 2. The author states that \"the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights.\" This suggests that the ethical obligations of women are often undervalued or not recognized as being equal to those of men. Passage 1, however, does not directly address this issue, so it is unclear if the author of that passage would agree with this claim.\n\n(D) Political activism is as important for women as it is for men.\nThe passages present contrasting views on this claim. Passage 1 states that \"whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere.\" This suggests that the author does not believe political activism is appropriate for women. In contrast, Passage 2 argues that \"whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do,\" which could be interpreted as supporting the idea that political activism is equally important for women. Therefore, it is not clear that both authors would agree with this claim.\n\nIn summary, the only claim that both passages clearly support is (A) - that women have moral duties and responsibilities.

The passage explains that Maguire's initial study on London cabbies found that their right posterior hippocampus, a brain region involved in spatial navigation, was 7% larger than normal. This suggested that the brain can physically change and adapt to new types of sensory input, a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity.\n\n2.

The goal was to find out if their brains were also structurally different from normal, or if they were just making better use of normal memory abilities.\n\n3.

However, the mental athletes were activating different brain regions, including the right posterior hippocampus, when compared to the control group.\n\n4. The passage states that this was \"surprising\" because the mental athletes were using brain regions associated with visual memory and spatial navigation when trying to memorize things like digits and snowflakes.\n\n5. The key question the passage says Maguire was trying to answer was: \"Do mental athletes inherit their unusual brain structures, or do the structures develop as a result of specific activities?\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) - Maguire's study of mental athletes was primarily intended to determine whether their unusual brain activity patterns were due to inherited brain structures or the result of specific memorization activities and practices.",
        "question": "In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the  labyrinthine streets of London might have oncabbies' brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to beinvolved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies-a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The moreyears a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.The brain is a mutable organ, capable-within limits-of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known asneuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structurewas more or less static. Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.After her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with ElizabethValentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the Londoncabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners  and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical 45 differences in the brains of the memory champs, evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering.

According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be 65 working in overdrive for the mental athletes.Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial70 navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn't seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in 75 their mind's eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers?

The passage describes Maguire's first study, where she found that the right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in spatial navigation, was 7% larger in London taxi drivers compared to normal individuals. This suggests that the taxi drivers' brains had physically changed due to their extensive experience navigating the city.\n\n2.

When Maguire and her team scanned the brains of the mental athletes and a control group, they found no significant structural differences between the two groups. The brains of the mental athletes appeared indistinguishable from the control subjects.\n\n4. However, the researchers did find a telling difference in the brain activity patterns. When the mental athletes were memorizing information, they were activating different brain regions compared to the control group, including areas involved in visual memory and spatial navigation.\n\n5. The passage states that this was surprising, as it wasn't clear why the mental athletes would be using these spatial and visual regions when trying to memorize things like numbers and snowflakes.\n\n6. According to the passage, the mental athletes reported that they were consciously converting the information they needed to memorize into visual images and distributing them along familiar spatial journeys. This was a learned strategy, not an innate talent.\n\nBased on this, the correct answer is (C) - the mental athletes exhibited different patterns of brain activity compared to the control group.

Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that \"Dad-dad\" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.\nIn describing the relationship between Eppie and Silas, the narrator draws a connection between Eppie's\n(A)physical vulnerability and Silas's emotional fragility.\n(B)expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life.\n(C)boundless energy and Silas's insatiable desire for wealth.\n(D)physical growth and Silas's painful perception of his own mortality.",

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nAnyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. \"Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing,\" says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \\mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. \"We didn't think this was possible,\" Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. \"Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down.\" 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says.

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\n\\section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes.

It then focuses on the relationship between men and women, suggesting that this was the last relationship to \"throw off the old rule, and receive the new\" due to the strength of the emotions involved.\n\nStep 2: Identify the key reasons suggested for the resistance to change in gender roles.\nThe passage suggests a few reasons why gender roles are resistant to change:\n\nA. \"in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated\" (lines 59-61). This suggests that the deep-rooted emotional associations with traditional gender roles make them resistant to change.\n\nB. The passage states that the \"proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to\" (lines 63-64), implying that gender roles should not be arbitrarily limited. This suggests that the traditional gender roles are resistant to change because they are ingrained and limiting.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the answer choices.\n(A) This is not the main point suggested in the passage. The passage focuses more on the emotional and tradition-based resistance to change in gender roles.\n(B) This is the best answer, as the passage directly states that gender roles are resistant to change due to \"the tenacity with which [they] cling to the forms and circumstances with which [they] have even accidentally become associated\" - i.e., deeply entrenched tradition.\n(C) The passage does not suggest that gender roles can only be influenced indirectly by legislative reforms. The focus is more on the inherent resistance to change.\n(D) The passage does not mention anything about groups or institutions in power benefiting from the current gender roles.\n\nTherefore, the answer that best reflects the passage is (B) - gender roles are resistant to change because they are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.",

        "output": "To solve this problem, I will go through the passages step-by-step and analyze the authors' perspectives on the individual's proper position in society.\n\nPassage 1 (Tocqueville):\n- Tocqueville discusses how democracy has brought more equality between different groups in society (e.g. fathers and sons, masters and servants).\n- However, Tocqueville believes that the inequality between men and women is the \"great inequality\" that still remains.\n- He critiques those who want to make men and women \"not only equal but alike\" by giving them the same functions, duties, and rights. Tocqueville argues this would degrade both sexes.\n- Instead, Tocqueville believes that the \"manifest design\" of nature was to give men and women distinct roles and responsibilities based on their different physical and moral constitutions.\n- He argues that \"improvement does not consist in making beings so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner.\"\n\nPassage 2 (Mill):\n- Mill discusses how society has historically been based on inequality, but now there is a trend towards \"a just equality\" in human relations.\n- He argues that the relationship between men and women has been the \"last to throw off the old rule\" of inequality.\n- Mill believes that \"the proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to.\" He argues there should be \"complete liberty of choice\" in occupations, without arbitrary limits based on sex or class.\n- Mill believes that \"employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them.\" The world will benefit from the \"best faculties of all its inhabitants.\"\n\nComparing the two authors:\n(A) This choice best describes the key difference between Tocqueville and Mill. Tocqueville believes an individual's position should be defined by their sex, while Mill believes an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.\n\n(B) This is incorrect. Neither author focuses on economic class as the primary determinant of an individual's position.\n\n(C) This is incorrect. Neither author focuses on temperament as the key factor.\n\n(D) This is incorrect.

        "question": "\\section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly co\u00f6perate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.\nWhich choice best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society?\n(A)Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.\n(B)Tocqueville believes that an individual's economic class should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that class is not a legitimate consideration.\n(C)Tocqueville believes that an individual's temperament should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that temperament should not be a factor in an individual's position.\n(D)Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding. 41",

        "solve_prompt": "Solve the following task. Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nThe Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open\nThe primary purpose of the passage is to\n(A)discuss findings that offer a scientific explanation for the Venus flytrap's closing action.\n(B)present research that suggests that the Venus flytrap's predatory behavior is both complex and unique among plants.\n(C)identify the process by which the Venus flytrap's closing action has evolved.\n(D)provide a brief overview of the Venus flytrap and its predatory behavior.\n",

The passage discusses the research by Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers, who proposed a model where the flytrap stores information about the number of trigger hairs touched in the electrical charge of its leaf. This model is then supported by the research of Alexander Volkov and his colleagues.\n\n3. The passage presents these scientific findings and explanations in detail, indicating that the primary purpose is to discuss the scientific understanding of how the Venus flytrap's closing mechanism works.\n\n4. The other options are not as well supported by the passage. While it does discuss the complexity and uniqueness of the Venus flytrap's predatory behavior (option B), this is not the main focus. The passage does not really identify the evolutionary process behind the closing action (option C), and it goes beyond just a brief overview of the Venus flytrap (option D).\n\nTherefore, the primary purpose of the passage is to discuss the scientific findings that offer an explanation for the Venus flytrap's closing action.",
        "question": "The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open\nThe primary purpose of the passage is to\n(A)discuss findings that offer a scientific explanation for the Venus flytrap's closing action.\n(B)present research that suggests that the Venus flytrap's predatory behavior is both complex and unique among plants.\n(C)identify the process by which the Venus flytrap's closing action has evolved.\n(D)provide a brief overview of the Venus flytrap and its predatory behavior.",

How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open\nWhich choice describes a scenario in which Hodick and Sievers's model predicts that a Venus flytrap will NOT close around an insect?\n(A)A large insect's second contact with the plant's trigger hairs results in a total calcium ion concentration above the trap's threshold.\n(B)A large insect makes contact with a second trigger hair after a period of inactivity during which calcium ion concentrations have diminished appreciably.\n(C)A large insect's contact with the plant's trigger hairs causes calcium channels to open in the trap.\n(D)A large insect's contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair.",

The passage describes a scene in a family-owned ink shop, where the narrator (likely the daughter) observes her father interacting with a customer and describing the qualities of the family's ink products.\n\n2. The narrator recalls a lesson from her \"Precious Auntie\" about the importance of effort and mindfulness in creating good ink, rather than just using mass-produced bottled ink.\n\n3. The narrator is impressed by her father's eloquent description of the ink's qualities, including its color, sound, and scent, indicating the care and craftsmanship that goes into making it.\n\n4. The main idea or theme that emerges from this passage is that **quality is achieved through deliberate effort** (option B). The passage emphasizes the importance of the artisanal process of making ink, rather than simply buying a mass-produced product. It highlights the value placed on skill, attention to detail, and the thoughtful application of one's craft.\n\nWhile the passage does touch on family relationships and the pride the narrator feels in her father's work, the overarching theme is focused on the significance of quality and craftsmanship, rather than on material compensation or the expression of creativity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) quality is achieved through deliberate effort.",

The narrator contrasts this with the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village, where the family's ink was made.\n\n5. Based on this contrast, the correct answer is (A) - the ink shop displays the family's ink more impressively.\n\nThe passage indicates that the ink displayed in the shop looked \"so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.\" This suggests that the shop provided a more impressive setting for showcasing the family's high-quality ink products.\n\nThe other options are not as well-supported by the passage.

        "question": "At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, \"Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.\"40 He picked up a bird shape: \"Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought.\" He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: \"Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind.\"As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. \"Look here,\" Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. \"See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this.\" And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. \"The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price.\"I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.\nThe narrator indicates that the contrast between the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village and her family's ink shop is that the ink shop\n(A)displays the family's ink more impressively.\n(B)is more conveniently located for the public.\n(C)provides greater individual attention to customers.\n(D)offers a larger space for presenting products.",

The passage states that slavery is not just a \"political question\" but also a \"question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of religion\" that deeply impacts the lives of millions.\n\n2.

No: the events of the last two years have cast their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright75 prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely our hearts cling to \"our altars and our homes,\" the80 more fervent are our aspirations that every inhabitant of our land may be protected in his fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom85 God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our course, then, still be onward!\nIn the passage, Smith most strongly suggests that slavery affects the United States by\n(A)lowering the country's reputation in the international community.\n(B)leading many women to disavow their allegiance to the country.\n(C)causing violent conflicts in many areas of the country.\n(D)weakening the authority of the country's government.",

In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. \"Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth,\" Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. \"We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment,\" Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet.

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\n\\section{Passage 1}\"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis,\" says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. \"Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth,\" Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. \"We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment,\" Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 \"standard of care treatment.\" That's going to take five years and $\\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.\nInformation in Passage 2 best supports which conclusion about the mice in the experiment described in Passage 1?\n(A)Exposure to teixobactin made them less susceptible to subsequent upper respiratory tract infections.\n(B)Gram-positive bacteria enhanced the effectiveness of teixobactin against their upper respiratory tract infections.\n(C)Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.\n(D)Teixobactin attacked the proteins of the bacteria that caused their upper respiratory tract infections.\n",

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nA pair of recent studies suggests that although.industrialized nations may have benefitted from larger.cities, the same is not true for the rapidly urbanizing areas of.the developing world. In these parts of the globe, there really.might be such a thing as too much urbanization, too.quickly..The studies, by Susanne A.

Their initial study, from last year,.examines the relationship between economic development,.as measured by GDP per capita, and average metropolitan-.area size in 114 countries across the world between 1960.and 2010. To ensure robustness, it controls for variables.including national population size, physical land area,.education levels, economic openness, and other factors..The size of cities or metro areas across the world has.exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the.developing world growing much faster and much larger.than those in more developed nations. Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew.modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median.city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding.from 220,000 to 845,000 people. In 1960, 12 of the top 20.countries with the largest average city size were high-.income countries; by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the.developing world..Urbanization has historically been thought of as a.necessary feature of economic development and growth, but.this study finds the connection is not so simple. While.advanced nations benefit from having larger cities,.developing nations do not. Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every.additional 100,000 in average population among its large.cities over a five-year period. But for developing nations, the.addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year.period..In their latest study, the researchers found that.developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck.from smaller and medium-size cities. These countries see.the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion.of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people.or less. Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic.impact in larger countries. Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic.benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million.or more, according to the study. This makes sense:.Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play.host to knowledge-based industries that require urban.agglomeration economies..There are several reasons why megacities^1 often fail to.spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world..For one, the lion\u2019s share of places that are urbanizing.most rapidly today are in the poorest and least-.developed parts of the world, whereas the places that.urbanized a century or so ago were in the richest and.most developed. This history has created a false.expectation that urbanization is always associated with.prosperity..Additionally, globalization has severed the historical.connection between cities, local agriculture, and local.industry that powered the more balanced urban.economic development of the past. In today\u2019s globally.interconnected economy, the raw materials that flowed.from the surrounding countryside to the city can all be.inexpensively imported from other parts of the world..The result is that the connection between large cities and.growth has now become much more tenuous, producing.a troubling new pattern of \u201curbanization without.growth.\u201d.The researchers used multiple variables to calculate a weighted average.city size for each country studied and reported the median of those.averages..(^1) Typically defined as cities with populations of over ten million people\nThe main purpose of the passage is to\n(A)describe the causes and consequences of a phenomenon.\n(B)propose a new solution to an ongoing problem.\n(C)question whether recent research has practical applications.\n(D)critique the methodology used to arrive at new findings.\n",

Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nFor too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy\u2014as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don\u2019t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law\u2014and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on \u2018practical measures\u2019 was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the \u2018record levels of expenditure\u2019 annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was\u2014or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.\u2018record expenditure\u2019 has been \u2018good enough\u2019. So the.\u2018practical\u2019 approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a \u2018practical\u2019 approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the \u2018fundamental flaw\u2019 of the federal government\u2019s efforts.over the past five years.

        "output": "To solve this problem, I will go through the passage step-by-step and analyze the central theme.\n\nThe passage starts by criticizing the view that \"a focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' rights takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' disadvantage.\" The author argues that this is a \"false dichotomy\" and that issues like poor health, lack of housing, and unemployment are in fact human rights issues.\n\nThe author then critiques the previous government's emphasis on \"record levels of expenditure\" on indigenous issues, arguing that the size of input is less important than the intended outcomes. The author states that this \"practical\" approach has lacked accountability.\n\nThe author then says that the challenge now is to \"redefine and understand these issues as human rights issues\" and to \"skill up\" the government and bureaucracy to use human rights as a tool for policy development and accountability.\n\nIn the final section, the author discusses a \"Statement of Intent\" signed by the Prime Minister, Opposition Leader, and various organizations, which commits to developing a long-term plan to achieve health equality, ensure indigenous participation, address social determinants, and respect indigenous rights.\n\nThe central theme that emerges from this passage is that (C) human rights should be used as a framework for government policy on indigenous issues. The author argues strongly against the \"practical\" approach that divorces indigenous issues from human rights, and advocates for framing them explicitly through a human rights lens.\n\nThe passage does not support the other answer choices. It does not suggest that expanding legal rights will not improve health outcomes (A), nor that human rights initiatives should generally receive more funding than health initiatives (B). It directly contradicts the idea that focusing on indigenous rights detracts from more practical concerns (D).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) human rights should be used as a framework for government policy on indigenous issues.",

The author, Calma, argues that these issues should be framed as human rights challenges, and that the government needs to work with indigenous communities to develop and implement effective policies.\n\nSpecifically, the passage highlights the \"Statement of Intent\" signed in March this year, which commits the government and other organizations to:\n- Develop a long-term plan of action, with the full participation of indigenous peoples, to achieve equality in health status and life expectancy.\n- Respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\n- Measure, monitor, and report on their efforts to realize these shared ambitions.\n\nBased on this, the passage indicates that Calma would most likely agree that programs related to indigenous issues would have a better chance of succeeding if the Australian government:\n\n(A) empowered indigenous communities to assist in devising and implementing such programs.\nThis is directly supported by the passage, which highlights the need for \"the full participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their representative bodies in all aspects of addressing their health needs.\"\n\nThe other options are not as strongly supported:\n(B) is not specifically mentioned, and the passage focuses more on the need for accountability and engagement rather than funding levels.\n(C) is not discussed in the passage.\n(D) the passage criticizes the previous government's focus on \"record levels of expenditure\" without accompanying progress or accountability.\n\nTherefore, the answer that is best supported by the passage is (A).",

It suggests that perhaps the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, where collisions would have been more frequent, and many differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies then scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.\n\nNow, to answer the question:\nThe passage most strongly suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find that there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.\n\nThis is because the passage suggests that the survival of primitive asteroids is a puzzle, since they are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. If collisional erosion was the sole explanation, then scientists would expect to find that primitive asteroids also suffered high rates of destruction, similar to the differentiated asteroids. The passage implies that the survival of so many primitive asteroids is at odds with the destruction of the differentiated asteroids, suggesting that the original populations were similar.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

It also depicts Little Chandler's ambivalent feelings towards the social world of Dublin and London.\n\nThe key evidence of a contradictory impulse in Little Chandler's character is found in the following passages:\n\n1) \"He turned often from his tiresome writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures\u2014on the children who ran screaming along the gravel paths and on everyone who passed through the gardens.

He is excited and apprehensive when encountering it, and even seeks out situations that he finds menacing.\n\nGiven this evidence, the best answer is (D) - He derives excitement from placing himself in settings he finds menacing.

Little Chandler remembers the time when he saw Gallaher off at the North Wall, and how Gallaher had already shown signs of success even then.\n\nStep 2: Identify the key points in the last paragraph.\nThe last paragraph focuses on Little Chandler's reflections on Gallaher's success. It states that Little Chandler \"could remember many signs of future greatness in his friend\" even eight years ago, suggesting that Gallaher's success was not entirely unexpected.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the main effect of the last paragraph.\nThe main effect of the last paragraph is to convey Little Chandler's sense that hindsight has lent a degree of inevitability to Gallaher's success (option A). The passage suggests that Little Chandler, in retrospect, can see the signs of Gallaher's future greatness, even though it may not have been so clear to him at the time.\n\nThis is the most accurate interpretation of the passage, as it captures Little Chandler's reflective attitude and his perception that Gallaher's success was not entirely surprising in hindsight.\n\nThe other options are not as supported by the text:\n- Option B is not the main effect, as the passage does not suggest that the news of Gallaher's success has significantly altered Little Chandler's memory of him.\n- Option C is not accurate, as the passage does not indicate that Little Chandler's confidence in Gallaher has been vindicated.\n- Option D is not the main effect, as the passage does not suggest that Little Chandler is regretful about not foreseeing Gallaher's success.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.",

Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless\u2019s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press!

The speaker then explains how their study of governments led them to conclude that governments are not instruments to alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed. Rather, the speaker came to understand that governments use their power to \"retard progress\" and silence dissent.\n\n3. The speaker elaborates on this point, explaining that political parties, once in power, care more about maintaining that power than keeping their promises to the people. They will use the machinery of government to \"crush opposition and silence the voice of the minority.\"\n\n4. The speaker expresses apprehension about a political party having control over all aspects of society, from education to literature and the press. This, the speaker argues, would be detrimental to the struggle for liberty.\n\n5.

He became interested in the \"Labor Question\" during the 1877 railroad strike. Initially, he thought the government could be used as an instrument to alleviate the suffering of the oppressed.\n\n2. However, after studying the history and tendencies of governments, he came to the conclusion that governments are inherently flawed. They use their concentrated power to silence dissent and maintain the interests of the few at the expense of the many.\n\n3. Parsons argues that it doesn't matter what promises a political party makes when out of power, as once in power, they will inevitably work to consolidate their power and crush opposition.\n\n4. He is appalled at the idea of a political party having control over all the details of people's lives, from education to literature and media.\n\n5. Ultimately, Parsons turned from political socialism to anarchism, as he believes that only in the absence of government can the full development of the individual be achieved.\n\nBased on these key points, the most reasonable inference is that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when (D) vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.\n\nThis is because Parsons believes that governments are inherently resistant to progress and that they will always work to maintain the status quo and silence dissent. Therefore, the only way for meaningful change to occur is through the persistent demands and actions of vocal individuals who refuse to be silenced.\n\nThe other options are not supported by Parsons' arguments. He does not suggest that mass political education (A) or political party reform (B) are the keys to progress. And he is clearly opposed to the idea of fewer political parties (C), as he sees the competition for power as a key driver of government abuses.",

Parsons states that she came to understand how \"organized governments used their concentrated power to retard progress by their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of discontent.\" This suggests that her main argument is that political parties in power will abuse their authority to suppress opposition (option A).\n\n2. She says that \"when the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a step, but not until then.\" This further reinforces the idea that political parties will use repressive measures to maintain their power.\n\n3. Parsons explains that she realized it doesn't matter what promises a party makes when out of power, because once in power, their priority will be to \"remain in power at all hazards\" and \"build up a powerful machine\" to crush opposition (option A).\n\n4. She expresses concern about a party in power controlling things like education, media, and other aspects of society, arguing this would be dangerous (option A).\n\nSo based on the overall arguments made in the passage, the best answer is (A) - Parsons' main argument is that political parties are inherently corrupt because human nature is too easily corrupted by power.",

Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism\u2014Anarchism^3 \u2014because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society\nAccording to the passage, Parsons\u2019s support for anarchism is based on the idea that anarchism\n(A)distributes wealth and property more equally among the population.\n(B)is indifferent to the social status of its adherents.\n(C)creates a situation that allows individuals to flourish.\n(D)allows people to create an organizational structure whose leaders will champion the rights of the oppressed.",

The great.accumulation of things almost hid the cracks in the.walls and the stains on the floor and the scratches.that clouded the windows..\u201cMi casa es tu casa,\u201d Celia joked as I looked.around. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what the Americans say?\u201d.She poured cold, crackling Coca-Colas for both of.us, and we sat on the couch, sipping them and taking.small bites of the chicharrones. She looked just as she.had the first time I met her: impeccably pulled.together, with a face full of makeup, fuchsia lips,.chestnut-brown chin-length hair curled at the ends.and tucked neatly behind her ears, small gold.earrings. So unlike most of my friends at home, who.used nothing but soap on their faces and aloe on.their hands and who kept their hair pulled into.ponytails, like mine, or simply combed after it had.been washed and left to air-dry..Celia told me about the provisions we would need.for winter\u2014heavy coats and a stack of comforters.and something called long underwear that made me.laugh when she tried to describe it\u2014and about a.place called the Community House where they.offered immigrant services if we needed them. She.gossiped about people in the building. She told me.that Micho Alvarez, who she claimed always wore his.camera around his neck, had a sensitive side, despite.the fact that he might look big and burly, and that.Benny Quinto, who was close friends with Micho,.had studied to be a priest years ago. She said that.Quisqueya dyed her hair, which was hardly.news\u2014I had assumed as much when I met her. \u201cIt\u2019s.the most unnatural shade of red,\u201d Celia said. \u201cRafael.says it looks like she dumped a pot of tomato sauce.on her head.\u201d She chortled. \u201cQuisqueya is a.busybody, but it\u2019s only because she\u2019s so insecure. She.doesn\u2019t know how to connect with people. Don\u2019t let.her put you off.\u201d.Celia began telling me about when she and Rafael.and her boys had come here from Panam\u00e1, fifteen.years ago, after the invasion..\u201cSo your son, he was born there?\u201d I asked..\u201cI have two boys,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth of them were.born there. Enrique, my oldest, is away at college on.a soccer scholarship. And there\u2019s Mayor, who you.met. He\u2019s nothing at all like his brother. Rafa thinks.we might have taken the wrong baby home from the.hospital.\u201d She forced a smile. \u201cJust a joke, of course.\u201d.She stood and lifted a framed picture from the.end table. \u201cThis is from last summer before Enrique.went back to school,\u201d she said, handing it to me..\u201cMicho took it for us.\u201d.In the photo were two boys: Mayor, whom I.recognized from the store, small for his age with.dark, buzzed hair and sparkling eyes, and Enrique,.who stood next to his brother with his arms crossed,.the faint shadow of a mustache above his lip..\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Celia asked. \u201cDo you have.other children besides your daughter?\u201d.\u201cOnly her,\u201d I said, glancing at my hands around.the glass.

The narrator visits Celia's apartment and describes the accumulation of things in her home, including \"a box of rinsed bottles on the floor, a small radio on top of the refrigerator, a plastic bag filled with garlic hanging from a doorknob, a collection of spices clustered on a platter on the counter.\"\n\n2. Celia then starts telling the narrator about some of the other people in the building. She mentions that \"Micho Alvarez, who she claimed always wore his camera around his neck, had a sensitive side, despite the fact that he might look big and burly, and that Benny Quinto, who was close friends with Micho, had studied to be a priest years ago.\"\n\n3. Celia also mentions that \"Quisqueya dyed her hair, which was hardly news\u2014I had assumed as much when I met her. 'It's the most unnatural shade of red,' Celia said.\"\n\nSo from this, we can see that the narrator knew about Quisqueya dying her hair before visiting Celia's apartment, as Celia says the narrator had \"assumed as much when I met her.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Quisqueya dyes her hair.",

The great.accumulation of things almost hid the cracks in the.walls and the stains on the floor and the scratches.that clouded the windows..\u201cMi casa es tu casa,\u201d Celia joked as I looked.around. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what the Americans say?\u201d.She poured cold, crackling Coca-Colas for both of.us, and we sat on the couch, sipping them and taking.small bites of the chicharrones. She looked just as she.had the first time I met her: impeccably pulled.together, with a face full of makeup, fuchsia lips,.chestnut-brown chin-length hair curled at the ends.and tucked neatly behind her ears, small gold.earrings. So unlike most of my friends at home, who.used nothing but soap on their faces and aloe on.their hands and who kept their hair pulled into.ponytails, like mine, or simply combed after it had.been washed and left to air-dry..Celia told me about the provisions we would need.for winter\u2014heavy coats and a stack of comforters.and something called long underwear that made me.laugh when she tried to describe it\u2014and about a.place called the Community House where they.offered immigrant services if we needed them. She.gossiped about people in the building. She told me.that Micho Alvarez, who she claimed always wore his.camera around his neck, had a sensitive side, despite.the fact that he might look big and burly, and that.Benny Quinto, who was close friends with Micho,.had studied to be a priest years ago. She said that.Quisqueya dyed her hair, which was hardly.news\u2014I had assumed as much when I met her. \u201cIt\u2019s.the most unnatural shade of red,\u201d Celia said. \u201cRafael.says it looks like she dumped a pot of tomato sauce.on her head.\u201d She chortled. \u201cQuisqueya is a.busybody, but it\u2019s only because she\u2019s so insecure. She.doesn\u2019t know how to connect with people. Don\u2019t let.her put you off.\u201d.Celia began telling me about when she and Rafael.and her boys had come here from Panam\u00e1, fifteen.years ago, after the invasion..\u201cSo your son, he was born there?\u201d I asked..\u201cI have two boys,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth of them were.born there. Enrique, my oldest, is away at college on.a soccer scholarship. And there\u2019s Mayor, who you.met. He\u2019s nothing at all like his brother. Rafa thinks.we might have taken the wrong baby home from the.hospital.\u201d She forced a smile. \u201cJust a joke, of course.\u201d.She stood and lifted a framed picture from the.end table. \u201cThis is from last summer before Enrique.went back to school,\u201d she said, handing it to me..\u201cMicho took it for us.\u201d.In the photo were two boys: Mayor, whom I.recognized from the store, small for his age with.dark, buzzed hair and sparkling eyes, and Enrique,.who stood next to his brother with his arms crossed,.the faint shadow of a mustache above his lip..\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Celia asked. \u201cDo you have.other children besides your daughter?\u201d.\u201cOnly her,\u201d I said, glancing at my hands around.the glass. The perspiration from the ice had left a ring.of water on the thigh of my pants..\u201cAnd she\u2019s going...\u201dCelia trailed off, as though.she didn\u2019t want to say it out loud..\u201cTo Evers.\u201d.Celia nodded. She looked like she didn\u2019t know.what to say next, and I felt a mixture of.embarrassment and indignation..\u201cIt\u2019s temporary,\u201d I said. \u201cShe only has to go there.for a year or two.\u201d.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain it to me.\u201d.\u201cShe\u2019s going to get better.\u201d.\u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a good school.\u201d.\u201cI hope so. It\u2019s why we came.\u201d.Celia gazed at me for a long time before she said,.\u201cWhen we left Panam\u00e1, it was falling apart. Rafa and.I thought it would be better for the boys to grow up.here. Even though Panam\u00e1 was where we had spent.our whole lives. It\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t it, what parents.will do for their children?\u201d.She put her hand on mine. A benediction. From.then, we were friends.\nBased on the passage, it is most reasonable to infer thatCelia knows the answer to which question about the narrator\u2019s family before the narrator visits her apartment?\n(A)How many children does the narrator have?\n(B)Where does the narrator\u2019s daughter go to school?\n(C)What is the narrator\u2019s profession?\n(D)How long have the narrator and her family lived in the United States?",

It notes that this plant no longer requires photosynthetic pigmentation (green coloration) to produce its own energy, as it relies on a mycorrhizal fungus for its resources. This allows the plant to adopt a broader range of coloration possibilities, similar to fungi or animals.\n\nThe key points from the passage that are relevant to the question are:\n\n1. Monotropsis odorata no longer requires photosynthetic pigmentation (green coloration) to produce its own energy.\n2. This allows the plant to adopt a broader range of coloration possibilities, beyond just green.\n3. The plant uses this ability to camouflage itself with the dried bracts that resemble the leaf litter, which helps it avoid herbivore damage and increase its fitness.\n\nGiven this information, the most reasonable inference is that the nutrient requirements of many plants have the consequence of limiting the plants' defensive options (option B).\n\nThe passage indicates that Monotropsis odorata's unique nutrient requirements (relying on a mycorrhizal fungus) free it from the constraints of photosynthetic pigmentation, allowing it to explore a broader range of defensive strategies like camouflage. This suggests that the nutrient requirements of many plants can, in fact, limit their defensive options, as they may be more constrained to using photosynthetic pigmentation for their energy needs.\n\nThe other options are not as well supported by the information provided in the passage. There is no indication that the nutrient requirements exaggerate the plants' coloration patterns (option A), increase their energy consumption (option C), or narrow their potential habitats (option D).\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable inference is that the nutrient requirements of many plants have the consequence of limiting the plants' defensive options (option B).",

Whenever Harouni visits the farms, Nawabdin is always there attending to the various household machinery and equipment.\n\n3.

Nawabdin asks Harouni to allow him to get a motorcycle, saying that with his old age and injuries, he can no longer bicycle from farm to farm as he used to. \n\n3.

The journalists we have quoted are.resistant to the democratisation of news:.the supremacy of the clickstream (according to.which editors raise or lower the profile of stories.according to the number of readers clicking on them.online); the parity of popular culture with \u201cserious\u201d.news; the demands of some audience members for.raw news rather than constructed narratives.\nWhich statement is best supported by information presented in the table?\n(A)Between 1985 and 2011, the proportion of inaccurate news stories rose dramatically.\n(B)Between 1992 and 2003, the proportion of people who believed that news organizations were biased almost doubled.\n(C)Between 2003 and 2007, people\u2019s views of the accuracy, independence, and fairness of news organizations changed very little.\n(D)Between 2007 and 2011, people\u2019s perception that news organizations are accurate increased, but people\u2019s perception that news organizations are fair diminished.",

The passage states that the \"new results provide a reason that Texas gourd plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: 'If you really ramp up the odor, you don't get more pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by your enemies.'\"\n\n4. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Why is there an upper limit on the intensity of the aroma emitted by Texas gourd plants?\" is (B) - Because increasing the fragrance too much attracts more damaging beetles, which in turn repels the pollinators that the plant needs.\n\nThe other answer choices are not supported by the information provided in the passage.",

        "solve_prompt": "Solve the following task. Solve the problem by thinking step-by-step.\nSolar panel installations continue to grow quickly,.but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the.doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that\u2019s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they\u2019d never go.below $1 a watt. \u201cNow it\u2019s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there\u2019s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,\u201d he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt\u2014not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems\u2014by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that\u2019s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green\u2019s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells\u2014a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers\u2014about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production\u2014thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green\u2019s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn\u2019t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn\u2019t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent. Adding another could make.efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which.would cut in half the number of solar panels needed.for a given installation. The challenge is to produce.good connections between these semiconductors,.something made challenging by the arrangement of.silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.\nThe passage is written from the point of view of a\n(A)consumer evaluating a variety of options.\n(B)scientist comparing competing research methods.\n(C)journalist enumerating changes in a field.\n(D)hobbyist explaining the capabilities of new technology.\n",

        "output": "To solve this problem, we need to go through the passage step-by-step and identify the key information related to the efficiency of two-sided solar panels.\n\nStep 1: Understand the key information about two-sided solar panels.\nThe passage mentions that one of Green's former students and colleagues, Jianhua Zhao, announced that he is building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided solar cell that can absorb light from both the front and back. The passage states that the basic idea is that during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels in a solar power plant, and this light reflects onto the back of the panels and could be harvested to increase the power output. The passage also mentions that this works particularly well when the solar panels are built on sand, which is highly reflective.\n\nStep 2: Identify the expected increase in efficiency for two-sided solar panels.\nThe passage states that \"where a one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts.\" It also mentions that Zhao \"expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more electricity over the course of a year.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine the correct answer.\nBased on the information in the passage, the correct answer is (B) absorbing reflected light.\nThe passage clearly states that the reason two-sided solar panels can increase efficiency is that they can absorb the reflected light that falls on the land between the rows of solar panels. This reflected light is harvested and used to generate additional power, leading to a 10-20% increase in electricity generation over the course of a year.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the passage:\n(A) is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the energy required to operate two-sided solar panels.\n(C) is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the manufacturing cost of two-sided solar panels.\n(D) is incorrect because the passage states that the reflected light is harvested, not prevented from reaching the ground.",
