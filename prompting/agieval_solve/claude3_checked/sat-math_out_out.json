This means that the actual weight of this horse is 10 pounds less than the reported weight.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the impact on the four statistical measures.\n(A) Mean: The mean is calculated by adding up all the weights and dividing by the number of horses. Changing the weight of one horse will affect the mean, as the sum of the weights will change.\n(B) Median: The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in order. Changing the weight of one horse may or may not affect the median, depending on where the new weight falls in the ordered list.\n(C) Range: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. Changing the weight of the horse with the lowest reported weight will affect the range, as the lowest value will change.\n(D) Standard deviation: The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data. Changing the weight of one horse will affect the standard deviation, as it is calculated based on the deviations from the mean.\n\nStep 3: Determine the correct answer.\nBased on the analysis, the only value that remains unchanged if the four values are reported using the corrected weight is the median (B).\n\nThe mean (A) and standard deviation (D) will change because they are affected by the change in the weight of the horse with the lowest reported weight.\nThe range (C) will also change because the lowest value in the data set has changed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Median.",

Evaluate the possible explanations:\n   (A) The percentages do not add up to 100%, so any possible conclusions from the poll are invalid.\n   This explanation is incorrect because the percentages provided (28% \"Yes\" and 70% \"No\") do add up to 98%, which is close enough to 100% for practical purposes.\n\n   (B) Those who responded to the poll were not a random sample of the population of the United States.\n   This explanation is likely the correct one. The viewers who responded to the poll on the show's website are not a random sample of the U.S. population. They are likely a self-selected group of individuals who were watching the show and chose to participate in the poll. This means the poll results may not accurately reflect the opinions of the broader U.S. population.\n\n   (C) There were not 50% \"Yes\" responses and 50% \"No\" responses.\n   This explanation is incorrect because the question does not require the responses to be evenly split between \"Yes\" and \"No\".\n\n   (D) The show did not allow viewers enough time to respond to the poll.\n   This explanation is not supported by the information provided.
