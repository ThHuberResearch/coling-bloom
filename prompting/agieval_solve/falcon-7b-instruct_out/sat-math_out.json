This means that there are multiple values of $x$ that satisfy the equation. Such values are $x=a$, $x=2a$, and so on. If no such values exist, then $a$ must be a divisor of $x$. The constant value $5$ satisfies this condition, so $a=5$. Therefore, the solved equation is $2 a x + 5 = 3(x+5)+5(x-1) = 5 x+5$. Then, simplifying the equation by adding $5$ gives the same value as $a x + 5(x+5)+5(x+5) = $a x + (x+5) - 5$. Combining this with the original equation gives the following: $a x - (x+5) + 5 = 3(x+5) - 5$. Now, subtracting $5$ from both sides gives $a x = (-1+5) +5$.

Thus, if $a = $5, then the solution is $a x = 9$ - 4 = $8$. If $a = 3$, then the solution is $a x = 9$ - 7 = $6$.
