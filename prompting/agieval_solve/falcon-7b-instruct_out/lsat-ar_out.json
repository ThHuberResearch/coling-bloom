Using this in the problem, we can replace T with mT, which simplifies the problem:\n\nProvisionally, let x be assigned to Juana, and assume y for the assignment of Mei or Olga. Then, for the number of facilitators, let p be assigned to mT, where m is the number of students overall.\n\nPlugging in these probabilities, we find:\n\np = m(mT + 1) = m(x+1) = x(x+1)\n\nNow, let z be assigned to the proxy for the green team. Then, z is equal to 1 if Mei is a facilitator, and z is equal to 2 if Kelly is a facilitator (since Kelly was assigned to analyse the data). Mei is not a facilitator, so we eliminate 2 and z = x for Mei. \n\nRegarding Olga, she is not a facilitator, so 1 is assigned to her. \n\nTherefore, to solve the problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem: z = b(p|x) with p the number of facilitators, b the prior belief of a facilitator in that group, and x the number of times a student has been assigned as a facilitator for that group. Substituting the numbers, x = mT was assigned to 0. Solving for b, b = (n-1)/(1+n-1), with n the number of students. So the answer is C: Olga is assigned to the green team.",
