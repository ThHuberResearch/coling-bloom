Therefore, the base radius could be found as (60/v), where v is the speed of the car.\nStep 4: Apply the Pythagorean theorem: The distance of the tower from the base is equal to (v^2 + h^2 - d^2)/2, where d is the distance the car travels in 10 minutes.\nStep 5: Substitute the values: Base radius = (60/v) = (6/v^2 + 45)/96\nStep 6: Calculate the radius of the tower: In the given problem, the radius of the tower is 30 units.\nThus, the length of the tower (imposed by the tower shadow) is 1000 meters.\nAfter some time, the top angle of the tower would be raised to 60\u00b0 and the radius of the tower would change to 60 units.\nBoth the length and elevation angle of the tower will change simultaneously once the tower reaches the base.\nThe base radius of the tower is 30 units, from which we calculate that the height of the tower is 1000 meters.\n\n(A)5 (5/7) (1000m) = 55.32m\n(B)6 (6/8) (1000m) = 75.00m\n(C)7 (7/1) (1000m) = 70.00m\n(D)8 (8/3) (1000m) = 33.333m\n(E)None of these\nThe base radius of the tower is 30 units.",

So the overall monthly income would be =  12000 + (30 % * 15000) = 6000.\n Therefore, the servant should achieve sales of 60 Lakhs in a month.\nLet's continue solving the problem.\nAfter distributing his salary, the shopkeeper has 7.5 Lakhs.

Now multiply this amount by 0.15 and add it to the monthly salary, we get Well, it\u2019s difficult to calculate exact numbers but let\u2019s use some clever approximation.

We are given that the sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109.\n\nStep 2: Reflect on the given information to form a problem. Given a three digit number consisting of digits with sum 17 and squared sum 109.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible solutions. Since the sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, the number will likely have only three digits. Further, we know that the sum of squares of its digits is 109.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate possible options. Since the sum of a number's digits must always be equal to the sum of the squares of its digits, a number consisting only of digits with sum 17 would be divisible by 4.However, when considering the sum of the squared digits of a three-digit number, which ends in 109, 417 would not be divisible by 4. Hence, the solution cannot be 417.\n\nStep 5: Apply the remaining possible options. Let's first consider 368. \n1. 8*1 = 8 \n2. 8*2 = 16 \nHence, the sum of the digits of 368 is 12 (8+4). Thus, we can discard 368.\n\nLet's now consider 377. \n1. 7*2 = 14 \n2. 7*3 = 21 \nHence, the sum of the digits of 377 is 14 (7+3). Thus, we can also discard 377.\n\nLet's finally consider the remaining possible number 288. \n\n1. 8*2 = 16 \n2. 8*3 = 24 \nTherefore, the sum of the digits of 288 = 24 (16+8). \n\nThe answer is 377.",
