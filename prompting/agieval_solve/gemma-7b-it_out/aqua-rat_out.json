We know that the perimeter is 48cm, so we can write:\n\nl + w = 48\n\n**Step 2: Find the area of the rectangle**\n\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = lw. Substituting the values of \"l\" and \"w\" from the previous step into this formula, we get:\n\nA = lw\n\n**Step 3: Find the value of \"w\" from the perimeter equation**\n\nWe already know that l + w = 48.

We can start by factoring the right-hand side:\n\nA = l(48 - l) = 48l - l^2 = 0\n\n(l - 8)(l - 6) = 0\n\nl - 8 = 0 or l = 8\n\nl = 8 and w = 48 - l = 40\n\n**Step 6: Find the area of the rectangle**\n\nFinally, we can find the area of the rectangle using the formula A = lw:\n\nA = 8*40 = 320cm\u00b2\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is 320cm\u00b2.
