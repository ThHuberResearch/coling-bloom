Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address emphasizes the importance of ending slavery as a moral imperative, while Thoreau's \"Civil Disobedience\" argues that individuals have a moral duty to resist unjust laws, including those that perpetuate slavery. In both cases, the abolition of slavery is a central concern that drives their arguments.",
