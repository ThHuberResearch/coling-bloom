Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes, so it produces 10 yo-yos in 9 x 10 = 90 minutes.\n3. Since both machines are working together, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 60 and 90, which is the smallest time when both machines will have produced 10 yo-yos.\n4. The LCM of 60 and 90 is 180. However, this means both machines will have produced 30 yo-yos (10 x 3 = 30). We want to find the time when they have produced a total of 10 yo-yos.\n5. To find this time, we can divide 180 by 3, which gives us 60. However, this is the time when Machine A has produced 10 yo-yos, not both machines.\n6. Let's find the time when Machine B has produced 5 yo-yos, which is 9 x 5 = 45 minutes. At this time, Machine A has produced 45/6 = 7.5 yo-yos (not an integer, so we need to round up to 8).\n7. Now, we need to find the time when Machine A has produced 2 more yo-yos to reach a total of 10. This will take an additional 2 x 6 = 12 minutes.\n8. Therefore, the total time is 45 + 12 = 57 minutes.

We need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum possible values of x.\n\nMaximum possible value of x: 9999\n\nMinimum possible value of x: 1000\n\nDifference: 9999 - 1000 = 8999\n\nHowever, none of the options match this answer. Let's re-examine the problem:\n\nThe problem asks for the difference between the maximum number of students and the minimum number of students in a particular subject, not the total number of students.\n\nLet's calculated the maximum and minimum number of students for each subject:\n\nMath:\nMaximum: 9999/16 = 624.9375 (round down to 624, since we can't have a fraction of a student)\nMinimum: 1000/16 = 62.5 (round up to 63, since we can't have a fraction of a student)\n\nBio:\nMaximum: 9999/10 = 999.9 (round down to 999)\nMinimum: 1000/10 = 100\n\nEnglish:\nMaximum: 9999/8 = 1249.875 (round down to 1249)\nMinimum: 1000/8 = 125\n\nNow, let's find the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum number of students in any subject:\n\nMaximum difference = 1249 (English) - 62 (Math) = 1187\n\nHowever, none of the options match this answer. The closest option is (C) 8890, but it's still not correct.\n\nIt's possible that the problem has a mistake or the options are incorrect.

Simplify the equation:\n\n5x + 20 = 10y^2\n\n5x = 10y^2 - 20\n\nx = 2y^2 - 4\n\n5. Since x is a two-digit odd number, it must be greater than or equal to 11. So, we can set up the inequality:\n\n2y^2 - 4 \u2265 11\n\n2y^2 \u2265 15\n\ny^2 \u2265 15/2\n\ny^2 \u2265 7.5\n\nSince y is an integer, the smallest possible value of y is 3 (since 3^2 = 9, which is greater than 7.5).\n\n6. Now, let's find the corresponding value of x:\n\nx = 2y^2 - 4\n= 2(3^2) - 4\n= 18 - 4\n= 14\n\nSo, one of the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers is 14+2 = 16. The other numbers are 16, 18, 20, and 22.\n\n7. Now, let's check the options:\n\n(A) 47 is not in the range of the possible numbers.\n(B) 91 is not a two-digit number.\n(C) 41 is not in the range of the possible numbers.\n(D) 67 is not in the range of the possible numbers.\n(E) 44 is an even number, not an odd number.\n\nNone of the options match the possible numbers we found. However, if we were to include 16 as an option, it would be the correct answer.",

To find the marked price (x), divide both sides by 0.8:\n\nx = 1440 / 0.8\nx = 1800\n\nSo, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800 to make a 20% profit even after offering a 20% discount.\n\nThe correct answer is (E) 1,800.",

In this time, it covers a distance of:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = 40 kmph x 3 hours = 120 km\n\nSo, at 2 pm, Train A is 120 km away from Mumbai Central.\n\n2. Now, Train B starts from Mumbai Central at 2 pm. To catch up with Train A, it needs to cover the distance of 120 km, plus the distance Train A travels from 2 pm onwards.\n\n3. The relative speed of the two trains is 72 kmph - 40 kmph = 32 kmph. This is the speed at which Train B is gaining on Train A.\n\n4. Time taken by Train B to cover the distance of 120 km (and catch up with Train A) is:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed = 120 km / 32 kmph = 3.75 hours\n\n5. Since Train B starts at 2 pm, it will catch up with Train A at:\n\n2 pm + 3.75 hours = 5:45 pm on the same day\n\n6. However, this is not the final answer. We need to find when the two trains will meet each other. Train A is still moving, and Train B needs to travel further to meet it.\n\n7. In the 3.75 hours it took Train B to cover 120 km, Train A would have traveled an additional distance of:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = 40 kmph x 3.75 hours = 150 km\n\n8. Now, Train B needs to travel this additional distance to meet Train A. Time taken by Train B to cover this distance is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 150 km / 72 kmph = 2.08 hours\n\n9.

Since the number of water lilies doubles every 2 days, we can find the number of doublings required to fully cover the lake:\n\n60 days / 2 days per doubling = 30 doublings\n\n3. Since there is 1 water lily initially, after 30 doublings, the number of water lilies will be:\n\n2^30 = 1,073,741,824\n\nThis is the number of water lilies required to fully cover the lake.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the case where there are 64 water lilies initially. We need to find the number of doublings required to reach the number of water lilies required to fully cover the lake (1,073,741,824):\n\n1,073,741,824 / 64 = 16,777,216\n\nTo find the number of doublings, take the logarithm base 2:\n\nlog2(16,777,216) = 24\n\nSo, it takes 24 doublings to reach the number of water lilies required to fully cover the lake.\n\n5. Since each doubling takes 2 days, the total time required is:\n\n24 doublings \u00d7 2 days per doubling = 48 days\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the number of days it would take for the initial 64 water lilies to double to cover the remaining area of the lake.

This means that the total time of the trip is the sum of the time it took him to drive from A to B and the time it took him to drive from B to A.\n\n2. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that it took him 3 hours to drive the last 70 miles to B, which means his speed during this time was 70 miles / 3 hours = 23.33 mph. However, we know that his speed was 70 mph, so this must mean that he was driving from A to B during this time.\n\n3. Since he drove the last 70 miles in 3 hours, he drove a total distance of 70 mph * 3 hours = 210 miles before the last 70 miles. This means the total distance from A to B is 210 miles + 70 miles = 280 miles.\n\n4. However, this is not among the answer choices. Let's re-examine our calculations. The time it took him to drive the last 70 miles was 3 hours, so the time it took him to drive the rest of the distance was x hours, where x is the time it took him to drive from A to B minus 3 hours. The distance he drove during this time was 70 mph * x hours = 70x miles. The time it took him to drive back from B to A was (280 miles - 70 miles) / 90 mph = 2.33 hours.\n\n5. Since the total time of the trip is the sum of the time it took him to drive from A to B and the time it took him to drive from B to A, we can set up the equation: x + 3 + 2.33 = x + 5.33, where x is the time it took him to drive from A to B. The total time is equal to the total distance divided by the average speed. The total distance is 2 * 280 miles = 560 miles. The average speed can be calculated as (70 mph * x hours + 90 mph * 2.33 hours) / (x + 2.33) hours.\n\n6. Setting up the equation and solving for x, we get: 560 miles / ((70x + 90*2.33) / (x + 2.33)) = x + 5.33. Solving for x, we get x \u2248 3.5 hours. The distance he drove during this time was 70 mph * 3.5 hours = 245 miles. The total distance from A to B is 245 miles + 70 miles = 315 miles.\n\n7. However, this is still not among the answer choices. Let's re-examine our calculations again. The mistake was assuming that the time it took him to drive from A to B minus 3 hours was x hours. Instead, the time it took him to drive from A to B was x hours, and the time it took him to drive the last 70 miles was 3 hours. The distance he drove during this time was 70 mph * x hours = 70x miles. The total distance from A to B is 70x miles + 70 miles.\n\n8. The time it took him to drive back from B to A was (70x + 70) miles / 90 mph = (7x + 7)/9 hours. The total time of the trip is x hours + (7x + 7)/9 hours. The total distance is 2 * (70x + 70) miles. The average speed can be calculated as (70 mph * x hours + 90 mph * ((7x + 7)/9) hours) / (x + ((7x + 7)/9)) hours.\n\n9. Setting up the equation and solving for x, we get: 2 * (70x + 70) miles / ((70x + 90 * ((7x + 7)/9)) / (x + ((7x + 7)/9))) = x + ((7x + 7)/9). Solving for x, we get x \u2248 2 hours.

Since there are two candidates, the total number of votes cast is equal to the number of eligible voters, which is 4,000.\n\n3. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, so the difference between the winning candidate's votes and the losing candidate's votes is 15% of 4,000:\n15% of 4,000 = 0.15 x 4,000 = 600\n\n4.

Since we want to find the minimum number of copper coins, let's try to maximize the number of brass coins. The maximum number of brass coins she can get is 340 / 25 = 13.6, which is not possible since she can't get a fraction of a coin. So, the maximum number of brass coins is 13.\n5. If she got 13 brass coins, she would get 13 x 25 = 325 cents from brass coins.\n6. This means she would need 340 - 325 = 15 cents more to reach the total amount of 340 cents.\n7.

        "output": "Let's break this problem down step by step:\n\n1. Allen and Bob travel towards each other. Let's assume they meet for the first time at point M, which is at a distance x from X and (Y - x) from Y.\n2. Since they travel towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which is 54 + 78 = 132 kmph.\n3. Let's assume they meet for the first time after time t hours. Then, the total distance traveled by both of them together is equal to the distance between X and Y.\n4. The distance traveled by Allen in time t is 54t, and the distance traveled by Bob in time t is 78t. Since they meet at point M, we can set up the equation:\n\n54t + 78t = x + (Y - x)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n132t = Y\n\n5. Now, Allen turns back and travels towards X, and Bob turns back and travels towards Y. Let's assume they meet for the second time after an additional time t' hours.\n6. The distance traveled by Allen in this additional time t' is 54t', and the distance traveled by Bob in this additional time t' is 78t'.\n7. According to the problem, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n54t + 54t' = 78t + 78t' - 48\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n54t - 78t = 78t' - 54t' - 48\n\nSimplify:\n\n-24t = 24t' - 48\n\nDivide by 24:\n\n-t = t' - 2\n\n8. Substitute t = Y/132 (from step 4):\n\n-Y/132 = t' - 2\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\n-Y/132 + 2 = t'\n\n9. The total distance traveled by Allen when they meet for the second time is 54t + 54t'. Substitute the expressions we found:\n\nTotal distance traveled by Allen = 54(Y/132) + 54(-Y/132 + 2)\n\nSimplify:\n\nTotal distance traveled by Allen = 54Y/132 + 54(-Y/132 + 2)\n= Y/2 + 54(2)\n= Y/2 + 108\n\n10. The total distance traveled by Bob when they meet for the second time is 78t + 78t'. Substitute the expressions we found:\n\nTotal distance traveled by Bob = 78(Y/132) + 78(-Y/132 + 2)\n\nSimplify:\n\nTotal distance traveled by Bob = 78Y/132 + 78(-Y/132 + 2)\n= 3Y/2 + 156\n\n11. Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, we can set up the equation:\n\n3Y/2 + 156 = Y/2 + 108 + 48\n\nSimplify:\n\n3Y/2 = Y/2 + 96\n\nSubtract Y/2 from both sides:\n\nY = 192\n\n12. Now that we have found Y, we can find the distance between X and Y:\n\nDistance between X and Y = Y = 192 km\n\nHowever, none of the options match this answer. Let's double-check our work:\n\nAfter re-checking, I found a mistake in step 5. When Allen and Bob turn back, they don't meet after the same time t'.

Let's analyze the table:\n\n1. The top-left corner has `M A D`. Since it's a multiplication table, we can assume that `M` is the multiplicand, `A` is the multiplier, and `D` is the product.\n2. The top-right corner has `B E`. This must be another multiplication, so `B` is the multiplicand, `E` is the multiplier, and the product is not shown.\n3. The middle row has `M A D` again, which is the same as the top-left corner. This suggests that the multiplication is being repeated.\n4. The bottom-left corner has `R A E`. Since `A` is the multiplier in the top-left corner, it's likely that `R` is the result of multiplying `M` and `A` (i.e., `M \u00d7 A = R`).\n5. The bottom-right corner has `A M I D`. This looks like another multiplication, but with `A` as the multiplicand and `M` as the multiplier. The product is `I D`.\n\nNow, let's try to fill in the numbers:\n\nFrom the top-left corner, we know `M \u00d7 A = D`. Since `D` is a single digit, `M` and `A` must be single digits as well. Let's assume `M = 9` and `A = 2`, which gives `D = 18`. But since `D` is a single digit, we can assume `D = 8`.\n\nFrom the top-right corner, we know `B \u00d7 E = ?`. Since `E` is a single digit, `B` must be a single digit as well. Let's assume `B = 9` and `E = 2`, which gives a product of `18`. This matches our assumption of `D = 8`.\n\nFrom the bottom-left corner, we know `M \u00d7 A = R`. We already assumed `M = 9` and `A = 2`, so `R = 18`. Since `R` is a single digit, we can assume `R = 8`.\n\nFrom the bottom-right corner, we know `A \u00d7 M = I D`. We already assumed `A = 2` and `M = 9`, so `I D = 18`.

The volume of the coin is the area of the circular base times the height:\n\nVolume = \u03c0(7.5)^2 \u00d7 2 = approximately 352.36 mm^3\n\n2. The weight of the coin is 30 grams, and the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver. Therefore, the total volume of the coin is divided equally between aluminum and silver:\n\nVolume of aluminum = Volume of silver = 352.36/2 = approximately 176.18 mm^3\n\n3. The density of a material is its mass per unit volume. Let's denote the density of aluminum as \u03c1_Al and the density of silver as \u03c1_Silver. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we can write:\n\n\u03c1_Silver = 2 \u00d7 \u03c1_Al\n\n4. The mass of aluminum in the coin is half of the total mass (30 grams), which is 15 grams. The volume of aluminum is 176.18 mm^3. We can find the density of aluminum:\n\n\u03c1_Al = Mass of aluminum / Volume of aluminum = 15 g / 176.18 mm^3 \u2248 0.085 g/mm^3\n\n5. Now, we can find the density of silver:\n\n\u03c1_Silver = 2 \u00d7 \u03c1_Al = 2 \u00d7 0.085 g/mm^3 \u2248 0.17 g/mm^3\n\n6. For the new coin, the diameter is 30 mm, so the radius is 15 mm. The thickness is 1 mm. The volume of the new coin is:\n\nVolume = \u03c0(15)^2 \u00d7 1 = approximately 706.86 mm^3\n\n7. Since the new coin is made of pure aluminum, its mass can be found using the density of aluminum:\n\nMass = Volume \u00d7 \u03c1_Al = 706.86 mm^3 \u00d7 0.085 g/mm^3 \u2248 60.08 grams\n\n8.

This means that the difference between 2272 and 875, which is 1397, is a multiple of N.\n\n2. Since N is a 3-digit number, it must be at least 100. Therefore, N cannot be a factor of 1397 (because 1397 is less than 100 \u00d7 14).\n\n3. So, N must be a factor of 1397 - 1000 = 397. The factors of 397 are 1, 7, 57, and 397.

After 6 months, the interest earned is 4% of x, which is 0.04x. The total amount after 6 months is x + 0.04x = 1.04x.\n\n4. Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, the interest for the next 6 months is calculated on the new total amount of 1.04x. The interest for the next 6 months is 4% of 1.04x, which is 0.04(1.04x) = 0.0416x. The total amount after 1 year is 1.04x + 0.0416x = 1.0816x.\n\n5.
