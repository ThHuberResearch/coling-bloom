The qualities of vitality, durability, and protection present in several of the gold disks may imply that Azazel is using divine power to counter Eppie's inferiority, which is his own defense mechanism (as he doesn't have the praise and worship that E)ppie has). Additionally, this inferiority further fortifies Azazel's pride (as in judging himself superior to the other gold disks), and distances him from divine grace (as a mortal creature - despite the latter being commonly depicted as inferior to God).

Therefore, the best approach could be to integrate the educational system and look for ways to build on the strengths of both genders without completely disregarding the biological and societal differences.
