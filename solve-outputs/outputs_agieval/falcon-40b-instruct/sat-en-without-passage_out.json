Hartmann found that the percentage of surface covered with weeds increased each year, so it's safe to assume that this finding would apply to the agricultural strips, but it's possible that Seydel's experiments with the different crops would have yielded different results.\n\nHartmann predicted that the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would have reached 90% after ten years, but Seydel made the original experiment in the hopes of showing that alternate farming methods could combat weed growth. Although Seydel's experiments with strips of groundcover and hemp did not produce any significant results, he was optimistic that the problem of weed growth could be tackled through other methods.\n\nBased on this passage, we can infer that Hartmann's prediction of an average increase of 2.6% per year in the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would have been supported by Seydel's experiments with wheat or corn.

While the founders recognized that slavery was a morally reprehensible practice, they failed to take strong action to end it, and instead built provisions for it into the Constitution. This shows a lack of commitment to their own ideals and a willingness to compromise their principles in order to maintain social and political stability.

Passage 2, on the other hand, suggests that Lincoln's view of slavery was rooted in the fundamental differences in religion and social values between Northern and Southern states, which made it impossible for the two sections to coexist with slavery. From Lincoln's perspective, slavery was a cancer that was slowly destroying the nation, and it could only be eradicated by ending slavery in all states. He believed that the Founding Fathers did not intend to make slavery a permanent condition, but instead recognized it as an evil that would eventually lead to its own destruction.

Teixobactin is an antibiotic that targets bacterial membranes, and while it's known to be effective against gram-positive bacteria, its effectiveness against gram-negative bacteria is not well understood.\n\nIn Passage 2, the authors discussed the mechanisms of teixobactin's antimicrobial activity and suggested that it may work by targeting the propriamides that are unique to gram-positive bacteria's lipid membrane.
