But if it is allowed, when was divorce possible in Jewish law? It is similarly in English law -- women married in any of the more religiously liberal (as a divicrir typically does). So if one parent is Jewish and one is not, would they legally need to change religion to become totally sanctioned? It should be noted that the Orthodox, Conservative and Orthodox Jewish (not Reform) all marry with the girl being out, so having a Jewish identity in- or out-of-marriage is also deemed valid under Jewish law.

Say X is a regular or frequent user of Tide laundry detergent, then X = frequent-purchase(Tide); but if X can provide evidence of being a frequent-purchaser(Tide) and also uses either product independently, that is also possible.
