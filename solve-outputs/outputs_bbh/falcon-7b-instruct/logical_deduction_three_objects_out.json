The periwinkle pan is third from the left.\nOptions:\n(A) The green pan is third from the right\n(B) The red pan is first from the right\n(C) The periwinkle pan is second from the right\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) The size of the largest pan is odd or one. For this part of the statement, we already know the answer is (A).\n(2) All the pans are to the left of the white pan. For this part, the white pan is missing from this description. Therefore, we know the order of the white panATION) in Synchronous Order to First Order.\nB: Let's just call the pan above the window \"x\". Thus by the logical deduction, the x represents the smallest size of pan, the first from the right. The periwinkle pan is actually the largest one. So we can deduce the colors described first. Each step represents the relative order from left to right. The saucepan is third from the left, the small pan is second from the left. After deducting the middle pan, we know (B) is correct.\nAnother deduction: Tomato carrots are pink. Periwinkle flowers are orange. So the most pink one is the middle one. The most orange one is the one next to the most pink one. To rephrase, \"the smallest pink one is the most pink.\" As we are only looking at the color of the dishes, we know (C) is correct. We reach a conclusion logically CONSISSTANT WITH other truths by which we made the deduction. The final deductivel statement is that the pan on the left is the biggest, followed by the pan on the right.\nCombining these facts, it is provable that the periwinkle pan is the second from the right. We reached this conclusion logically CONSISTENT WITH other truths. The answer is (C) so the correct answer is (A).\nQ: The following sentences each describe a set of three unique colors. The statements are logically consistent within each SENTENCE.

So the answer is (C).\n\nA set of objects can be established to be in the form of a nested years list. They are arranged in chronologically ascending order. For example, a 500 year list looks like this: 1 = 1048, 2 = 1492, 3 = 1756, and so the first value of the year is in the middle of the list.\nAn ordering of objects with a list shown below can be transformed into a nested years list by copying the middle position and incorporating the first position to return an ordering of the list. In this example, 100 is in the middle and in the list. The result of which is 10021.\nHere is a new ordering of a list on the 11th day in August which is 1405.\nAn example may be taken with a list of ingredients, meals, etc. Each order of the list is original and selected to make an interesting blog post or a unique statement based on the device or order specified.\nFor example, a list of three ingredients in the following submission:\nNectarine, raspberry, or watermelon has the following order to create a sentence with a focus:\nThe list of the substances and the corresponding names are ordered by the year of the list. For example:\nThe Australian arsonist who attended his sister's birthday celebration under the name Bill Honeynut executed three lethal arsons in order on the list. These are the names are two other phrases of Bill Honeynut that have an original meaning to them. Constructing a sentence from them might create the following: Honeynut's three arsons would have the warming sensation of his sister's synthetic coat. Nevertheless, despite all the harm he inflicted to the family, the feelings were still an ardent amalgamation of natural warmth in bid for a front-row seat for his daughter's birthday by young Honeynut.", "task_prompt": "A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.

We can call the right-most golf club, \"x-th club\". So option (A) is correct. Mel is the rightmost.\nThe order of clubs in the golf terms of Paypal is: driving green iron x-th club hammer-and-club x-th club. We can call the center club \"cm\". In the highest interval of the golf club family, the name of the club between them is x-th club, so in this case, 'th' club is a white iron golf club and 'x' club is a black iron golf club. Mel does not fit the logic of ordering clubs this way, and neither do 100 through 500 clubs. \n\nFor example, Mel is 5 clubs ahead of the a white two iron golf club. The golf club database is stretched by two clubs since the convention of the iron golf club is 9 clubs strong, while a white two is not a club. Therefore, we can deduce that Mel is a red iron golf club by its own shape. It makes no difference if you go to the logo. The color scheme of these irons is often different for each manufacturer. Secondly, not only are these golf club names distinct, but this is also different from the less conventional approach of using senior senior junior positions in the url in a URL segment violation. So it fits Mel's Master rankings and criticism.\nTherefore, Mel cannot be considered popular in either system. They are active because they are always accessed in a club setting. She can also simply be searched for Academy, so I am more focused on the head position golf club names from my first design, such as Maria Del Pilar, Maria Fausta, Maria Sofia, Maria Teresa and Paula Gonzales. Please join this discussion about how the names should match the formation because leading clubs are simple designs.

We can rule out A as this alternative definition uses a (beta combinator) to represent a shield of snow in place of the hammer necklace. We also can rule out x as it represents a (p.d.) option for crown of gold necklace which has not clear reference in the descriptions. Taking H=this, we can conclude that one of the other two descriptions can fit it as the necklace is produced from metal using a hammer whilst the coin necklace can represent a financial system which directs coins to be used as fractional currency. So starting with A as this follows the pattern we can rule it out as 0%. Taking B, we can conclude that the sisters were so close in the area that they made a continuous loop like the hammer necklace to commemorate themselves with watching function(Cont.3). In other words, it could represent a sentimental value to the wearer. Therefore one can conclude that this option is 1% likely. To take the next 100%, we order after each other the remaining options A and B. It seems that the necklace was constructed from metal and therefore most likely associated with Brittle items or even the hammer necklace in this context. So by the time B is ruled out the representation of this option is highly likely. Thus one can conclude that this option is more than 100% likely defined.

Organizations of these bits can create infinite digits. Their sum of the two digits is the prime integer. Therefore, we grip A, ignoring the tailed number (nest (41,10), or 1920, 40910).\n(3) Back to the options. The prime numbers (2,3 ,5) do not have a left tail. The common digits between them are 11,25 in option A a the common digits between them are 28,45 in option B.\n(4) In option B our left tail is to see only four digits. 0,000,32 and 100,33 are the right tails.

A number being referred to as a tour would be 1, 2, or 3. In this case, we look for a number that is a tour of the board.\n(2) Tour 2 is the first number from left to right, therefore to the immediate right of (A) is 2 and to the immediate left of (A) is 3. Therefore, in this case, the most common number is 2. So, (B) (tour 2) is the most common.\n(3) Combining (1) and (5) we get 14 ? tour (which is not one of the options). Therefore, we can remove option (A) and all of its combinations from the list.\n(4) Combining (1) and (2) we get 10 ? 1 ; then, we can replace each of 1 and 2 with both of their digits within a number for all of their combinations. The possible 4 digits in the 4 nitrogen atoms in one cubic atom are 24. This means there are options for every number from 1 to 3. Therefore, (C) is the most common. Hence, the answer is (B).\n\nQ: Leonardo Da Vinci's monocle is suspended from the ceiling by two wires. The two wires are of different thickness. One is larger than the other. But the larger wire also has twice the length of smaller wire. Outrageous, shouldn't that lead to the wire getting stretched out about thrice more? And if so, why does the monocle have such a long wire?\nOptions:\n(A) The monocle hangs almost twice the length further\n(B) To make it level with the rails\n(C) It is used for power\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) The suspension of the monocle from the ceiling by the two wires makes it possible to turn and look down. The more slack in the wires, the more they give. If a wire were twice as long as the smaller, we cannot lean it away from the larger thick one. Since we cannot separate them, the montre is going to keep turning down with each tilt from ear to ear. So, the angle at which we see our reflection in the mirror inflated in the center looking in the mirror. If so, shouldn't we see a larger angle of the larger wire but our distance from the mirror should be only the same as 1/2 the small thickness wire? Therefore, how is it possible to be so close to one another while yet far apart in the center? The explanation for this paradox occurs in the Pythagorean theorem which we will later use.\nQ: Two old radiator pipes are laid on a wooden table.

You then have to bend the tallest pipe to check its temperature. How high does this tallest pipe smolder?\nOptions:\n(A) It smolders in the center nearest to the coldest pipe\n(B) It smokes in the center even in the middle of the two hottest pipes\n(C) It is only hot because it strays in a rack of warm pipes\n(D) Delicate instruments will melt\n(E) Once in a hot shop.\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) Guess from the given options that the tallest pipe has the highest water temperature out of the three in the picture. This pipe is the hottest. As the vapor brings in the warm air, since there are no places for it to dissipate heat, you feel the air getting warm, thus you conclude this pipe has the highest temperature.

There may be an a small tip of 5-10 cents. If his coffee costs a total of $6.00 and we deduct the tip probability is $0.50 and add or subtract $0.10 for coffee, the result is $5.45 or $5.35. Now, are you conscious level.\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) He was obviously by a 55.6% chance of either being $5.45 or $5.35.

What would be the result of the following calculation?\n14 % of 44 = 3 %\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) 42 % of 44 = 73 %\n(2) So after the reduction, the percentage changed by 72 % which means a rise from 12% to 22%\n(3) We can see that 22 % of 44 which is 434 % subtracted from 44 leaves us with 10 %.\nSo the difference between 10% and 12% is 49 pips.\nSince an increase of 49 pips is equivalent to 0.0092, it means that after the reduction in interest, the result is a rise of 0.01528 pips and the final value is 0.0095. (I rounded up since it would be ever so slightly less than 0.014 %.)

Nonetheless, Rob was further from the third place than Mel is from the second and Mel is from the first.\nTherefore, we can deduce that (C) Rob finished last. So the answer is (B).\n\nQ: On a sports field, there were three soccer teams: the black team, the red team, and the green team. The black team was on the left side. The red and green teams, which formed a rectangle, were on the right side. Which sport would have a green team?\nOptions:\n(A) Volleyball\n(B) Soccer\n(C) Basketball\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) According to this description, the team to the right (red and green) is positioned on the right.\n(2) To the left of the large white area inside the rectangle is the black soccer team. Therefore, we know the soccer team must be on the right side of the black team and the right side of the white rectangle.\n(3) Now we know that volleyball is played with a white subtile. Therefore, we can deduce that volleyball is the sport on the left side of the rectangle.\nHence, the answer is (A).\n\nQ: In a tennis tournament, there were four tennis players: Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Pete Sampras, and Jimmy Conners. The two youngest players were on the left side of the square.\nOptions:\n(A) Roger Federer is facing one of the oldest tennis players\n(B) Rafa Nadal faces one of the oldest tennis players\n(C) Pete Sampras faces one of the youngest tennis players\nA: Let's assume that Rafael Nadal is the oldest tennis player.\n(1) According to whom is Nadal facing. We know shingles tennis cannot be left most of the tennis court yet his coach is on the left side. Therefore, we can exclude option A.\n(2) Based on the description which tennis player is the one facing the youngest tennis player. However, we cannot exclude the answer that is not directly dictated by the description as we cannot appreciate the actual tennis part. Therefore, we cannot conclude which tennis player is the widest.\n(3) Based on the description which tennis player is facing the middle tennis player (second from the left) in the tournament. Therefore, we can only assume that Federer faces Melisa Deias, Pete Sampras. However, the latter does not face a tennis player on the strip. It faces Fedor Enqvist who is under Federer's wingsfan on the ride. Therefore, the answer is that the tennis partner of Fedor Enqvist is the swimming partner.\nHence, the answer is (B).\n\nQ: On a ten tennis match, the female player must be the second from the left as the male player is the last of the tennis court.\nOptions:\n(A) Linda Evans\n(B) Patricia Ann Casey\n(C) Monica Seles\nA: Let's think step by step using the premise of the tennis court sides. Sports have edges, so we exclude a candidate based on this fact.\nThe answer to the tennis player is, let's say, the fourth from the left.\nLet's think about:\n(1) Three tennis players are standing on the side (the outer edge of tennis court). Therefore, if Elaine is the female in the corner-left from the male, we can rule out her entry as the second tennis player. Next we should think about the corners, left, right which each tennis player can occupy if there are two in parallel positions. Next we rule out any as the second tennis player from both other tennis players. Therefore, Elaine is the second tennis player from left side of the tennis court from the left side.\nAlso, two female tennis players (and two males) are placed behind each other. Therefore, we can rule out any of the tennis players from playing covers from the straight lines from the circles on the tennis court.\nBased on this information, we can determine that the tennis player is right from the third from the left (from the left) and answering \"B\" based on the description.\nWith the answers of these two statements, we can voir the position of the tennis player resulting in (B) \u201cPatricia Ann Casey\u201d.", "task_prompt": "A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.

In a vocal-based classification system, a vocal unit is used for mapping to musical-based triadic traits. In a sequential classification, using five ranks of timbre and tempo work well, as indicated by a generative model. In a data-based classification, relating to the music data of various genres (for example, Bach cantata Vs.

Woodyl has mountains and elevations so we could plot color coded lines indicating elevation. Let's call this the \"elevation mapping\" approach. There are clearly two of them.\nTo plot them on map I'd need to use labels on map to indicate elevation. That's twice the number of lines since there are two of the mountains. If map key made a physical representation of the map using this method, it would be a very long line.\nDrivers suggest one pair of turns to climb higher mountain. We can visualize the notification through the turn? The Elevation Mapping approach would be both simple and elegant.\nTherefore, let's go with the aesthetic approach to mapping mountains and offer you the Elevation Mapping approach that uses two kinds of labels for a user to use to denote a hill on a map.\nTo use this Elevation Mapping on PDF or HTML, choose the label for your elevation mapping system and then use the shinyapp to indicate elevation by selecting one color for one elevation groupon one side of the PDF, for example, and a different color for the other side.\nThe choice of colors is really your preference based on their color schemes and mapping.\nThe mapping can be done in Excel.

Therefore, if the fruit stand were to sell oranges, they would be more expensive and thus the a set of three oranges would cost more than the set of three cantaloupes.\nTo find a way to represent this conclusion, we can use the following reasoning:\nWhen the fruit stand first opens, the set of products they offer could be labeled as the type of item the \"price multiplies\" itself on each one.\n Of items #1 and #3 let it be called $5.00.\n Watermelons are offered at $0.00. \n Of items #2 and #3 let it be offered at $10.00. \n\nWatermelons, the first item on the list are offered at $0.00, much less than $10.00. Whereas, oranges, the second item on the list, are offered at $0.70 which is less than $1.00 and cantaloupes which are sold for $ 5.00 are offered closer to $7.00 and the comparison is closer to $1.70 as $0.43 more expensive.", "task_prompt": "A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.

In how many different ways can the following events be arranged in a way that all the events are in the correct order?\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) We can arrange the events either (A) \"A before B before 2\" or (B) \"1 before 2 before A\".\n(2) There are three events, L, B, T, and A.\n(a) Option A: {L, T, A; \"before 2\"; B>Possible}\n(b) Option B: {L, B, A; \"1 before 2\"; \"after 2\"; B>A; X>B; X>T<B}\n(c) Option C: {T, B>A; \"after 2\"; {L, T, A; \"3 before 2\"; \"unknowable\"; {L, B>A; \"before 2\"; B<T<B\"}\n(d) Option D: {A, B, T; }\n(e) Option E: {T, B>A; A, B>T; B<T<B>}\nTherefore, the possible orders are...\n{Option A: {T, A, A; T<B>A<A>; A<A<B>B<T<B>; B<A<T<T<B>; B<B<T<B>T<B<B<\nOptions:\n(A) T < B < A\n(B) T < A < B\n(C) A < B < T\n(D) B < A < T\n(E) T < B < A\nThe third option is (A) T < B < A, so (A) also is a possible arrangement of the events.\nQ: What are the three events in the following sequences?\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) A: The people are leaving their homes and are in the shape of (across) a horizontal line. According to this, we'll have to take two straight lines between individuals characterized by the same number of story homes.\n(2) Each story home typically comprises of multiple rooms, let's say, 4 rooms. Each room could have multiple inhabitants, but let's concentrate on only one. So, when we're looking at special one occupying his or her own rooms we don't care about everybody's individual representations of themselves. So, let's take 4 rooms, 1 kitchen, and 1 living room in each sequence for distribution.\n(3) Let's assign our living room to a separate group, since usually we know our living room by sight before the other rooms.\n(4) The first group needs to go to the shared bathroom, so, let's assign it a separate room dealing with personal effects, known as the bathroom.\nCurrently, the first group consists of individuals 1, 2, 2 and 3. The individuals in the rest of the rooms will be found/denoted by order from 4th to 6th company\nAnd, we want to find out which individual of the first group shares a name with the rest....\nA: We have 4 new reports in which each report comprises of an unknown number of stories. According to the basic math that inside each house there could be 4 rooms, now we can determine the 'number' of rooms in each house by counting their 4 rooms.\n(4) Each story houses identical number of rooms (UNIQUE)\n(5) Let's determine by average the number of rooms in each house.
