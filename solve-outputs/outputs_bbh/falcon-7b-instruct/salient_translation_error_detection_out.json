According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is \"Ein Liste der Schutzgebiete in Aylinge an der Landstra\u00dfe Augsburg\". On the other hand, the provided translation is \"Ein Liste der Schutzgebiete in Aylinge am BN Augsburg\". The translation has an error because the correct name of the city capital \"Augsburg\" is written twice. To resolve this error, the word \"Augsburg\" should be removed from the translation. So the correct translation is \"Ein Liste der Schutzgebiete im Landkreis Augsburg\". Another error that needs correcting is the use of \"Ein liste\" instead of \"Ein\" (German for \"a\" and \"an\"; English translation should be \"a list\"). The correct translation is \"Eine Liste\" (as an English translation from \"a\" to \"an\"). The corrected sentence is \"Ein Liste der Schutzgebiete in Aylinge an der Landstra\u00dfe Augsburg\".", "task_prompt": "Detect the type of error in an English translation of a German source sentence.\n\nQ: The following translations from German to English contain a particular error.
