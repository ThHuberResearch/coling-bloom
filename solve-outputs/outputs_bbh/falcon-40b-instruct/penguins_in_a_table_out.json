Also, we have the following information: Louis is 7 years old, Gwen is 8 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and James is 12 years old. Therefore, according to the table, 49 kg is the average weight of the penguins.\nTo answer the given question, we need to find out which penguin is 60 cm tall. We know that James is 12 years old and 12 cm tall. Thus, we can find the height of James as per its age. Now, we need to find out the weight of each penguin to get the height that corresponds to each penguin.\nThe height-weight relation tells us that the height of 49 Kg is 60 cm.\nHere, we know that James is 12 years old and weighs 90 Kg.\nUsing the equation, we can calculate the weight of James as per his age:\nWeight (kg) = 49 / (1.12)12 + 60\nWeight (kg) = 44.07\nTherefore, James is not 60 cm tall.\nThus, the answer is (B).\n\nThe following questions focus on a table of penguins and their attributes.\n\nQ: Here is a table of penguins and their attributes:  For example:  name, weight = 101 kg, height = 76 cm.

Its weight is 50 kg, and its height is 50 cm. Therefore, to check whether it is less than 93 cm, we need to check the height of Louis, which is 50 cm. Since 940 / 0.5 > 106, we can infer that Louis is indeed less than 93 cm. Therefore, the answer is (B).\n\nQ: Here is a table of penguins: Rockhopper, Gentoo, Adelie, Chinstrap, Emperor.

Here, we have 5 penguins, and the sum of their ages is 5 * 7 + 5 * 5 + 9 * 9 + 11 * 8 + 15 * 7 = 107 + 125 + 81 + 99 + 126 = 518. Hence, the average age of the penguins is 518/5 = 103.6 years old.\n\nTo estimate the average weight, we can use a similar approach. Here, we first need to convert the height from centimeters to meters since penguins are taller than humans. For example, the height of Gwen is 8 cm, so his height in meters is 0.08 meters. Therefore, the height of James is 258 meters. Using this information, we can estimate the average weight of the penguins. The sum of the weights of Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen is 7 * 50 + 5 * 80 + 9 * 60 + 15 * 70 = 107 + 400 + 540 + 945 = 1712/4 = 425.5 kg. The estimated weight of James is 258 kg.

Then, we divide that sum by the number of penguins. So, the average age of the penguins in the table is 8. (39 / 5 = 7.8)\nQ4: Which penguin has the greatest weight?\nAns: James has the greatest weight among the penguins in the table.\nOverall, these questions help assess a candidate's skill in data interpretation and analysis as well as their ability to identify patterns and trends in data.", "task_prompt": "Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.\n\nQ: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

Now, if we add Louis's age to it, we will have the new sum.\nThe new sum with Louis's age in it is 106 years old. Now, we subtract Bernard's age from the sum of the remaining penguins' ages and find the remaining sum. This remaining sum is equal to 20 (61 - 20). Now, if we add Louis's age to it, we will have the new sum.\nThe new sum with Louis's age in it is 106 years old. Finally, we subtract Bernard's age from the sum of the remaining penguins' ages and find the remaining sum. This remaining sum is equal to 20 (61 - 60 - 1). Now, if we add James's age to it, we will have the new sum.\nThe new sum with James's age in it is 166 years old.\nThe sum of the ages of all remaining penguins, after adding James and deleting Bernard, is 166 years old.
