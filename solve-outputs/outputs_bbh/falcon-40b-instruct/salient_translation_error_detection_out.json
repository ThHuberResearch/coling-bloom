The examples of the Named Entities and Dropped Content: Monuments are easier than Modifiers or Adjectives and Negation or Antonyms. Therefore, Our model can detect errors based on their different types, as they can pose different challenges to the models. This finding confirms the feasibility of the E2E neural system we developed in our final project. Our model initially learns the general meanings and language styles from the larger language databases in the early stage. It then detects the personal questions, discourse coherence, domain knowledge, and source expertise errors sites with more flexibility, using the trained expertise knowledge to accurately answer and generate the desktops ones.\n\nFurther, we can see that the dataset has significant variance of error types, which can increase the difficulty of training and generation. In our study, we used the ADDM dataset proposed by Adel et al. ([2020]), which contains six different types of errors. Further, Adel et al. also proposed the POSCUP dataset that can include other error types (e.g., factual errors) in non-ditto questions. Therefore, we can train and evaluate the E2E model with different", "task_prompt": "Detect the type of error in an English translation of a German source sentence.\n\nQ: The following translations from German to English contain a particular error.

Revision: Revision involves checking and comparing the translated text with the source text to identify any errors. Translators should approach revision in a mindful and focused manner, taking breaks in between the revision process. Revision should be done with a fresh pair of eyes to avoid overlooking errors.\n\n2. Proofreading: Proofreading is a tool that helps ensure that a text is free of errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and formatting. This type of attention is typically provided by a second pair of eyes or by software designed for this purpose.\n\n3. Automatic translation tools: Auto-correction software or translation tools can be beneficial for finding mistakes in the translation process. However, translators should use caution and analyze the suggestions before making corrections.\n\n4. Collaborative proofreading: Collaborative proofreading involves working together with a colleague or with peers to identify errors.
