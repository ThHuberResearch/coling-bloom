This means that the expressions within parentheses are evaluated first, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction. In the problem at hand, the equation can be written as \"(-6 * -1) + (2 + (-2 - 2)) + (9 - 4 + -1 - 7)\", where the multiplication and addition operators are evaluated in their order of precedence. Since multiplication takes precedence over addition, the first term is evaluated as \"-6 * -1 = 6\", and then the addition operator is applied to the rest of the terms in the equation. Subtraction also takes precedence over addition, so \"2 + (-2 - 2)\" is evaluated as \"0 * -4 = 0\", and then the addition operator is applied to the rest of the terms in the equation.

Not following the order of operations: people often forget the order of operations and solve equations in an arbitrary order.\n\n2. Not using parentheses or brackets: people often forget to use parentheses or brackets to indicate that certain operations should be solved before others.\n\n3. Forgetting to carry or borrow: when performing arithmetic operations involving several numbers, people often forget to carry or borrow. This can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n4. Making careless arithmetic errors: people often make careless errors when adding, subtracting, or multiplying numbers.\n\nTo avoid these common mistakes, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem, use parentheses and brackets as needed, carry or borrow as appropriate, and double-check one's work for errors.

Some tips for solving multi-step arithmetic problems quickly and accurately:\n\n1. Keep in mind the order of operations: Whenever there are multiple operations in an arithmetic problem, it's important to follow the order of operations - parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division (left to right), addition/subtraction (left to right). This will help you avoid common mistakes such as evaluating an exponent before multiplication/division.\n\n2. Look for opportunities to apply math properties: Math properties such as commutativity and associativity can make calculations easier and faster. For example, in the problem (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4), we can see that multiplication and addition are both being performed. However, using the property of commutativity, we can first perform the multiplication (-3 * 5 = -15) and then add the result to the other two terms.\n\n3. Use mental math: Mental math can be a valuable skill when it comes to solving complex problems quickly. This involves using mental shortcuts and estimates to calculate answers quickly without the need for written calculations.\n\n4. Practice, practice, practice: The best way to improve your speed and accuracy when solving math problems is to practice consistently.

So the answer is 576.\n</s> \nWhat strategies can be used to simplify and solve these multi-step arithmetic problems?</s> \nThere are several strategies that can be used to simplify and solve multi-step arithmetic problems:\n\n1. Use the order of operations: Always follow the order of operations when solving problems. Multiply and divide before adding and subtracting.\n\n2. Group like terms: Grouping like terms can help simplify the expression and make it easier to solve. Look for any common factors that can be multiplied together.\n\n3. Use the distributive property: When multiplying a number by a sum, you can distribute the number across the terms in the sum. This can help to simplify the multiplication and make the expression easier to solve.\n\n4. Simplify fractions: Look for opportunities to simplify fractions by dividing out common factors.\n\n5. Estimate the answer: Use estimation to get an idea of the answer. For example, if the problem asks to find the sum of 3/4 and 8/7, estimate that the sum is less than 1, so the answer will be smaller than 9/5.\n\n6. Check the answer: Use some actual numbers to check the answer. For example, if the problem asks to find 2/3 of 45, use some actual numbers like 20, 30, and 40 to check the answer.

Identify the parts of the expression: x, x^2, 2^3, 10, 9\n2. Break down the rest of the expression: 4x^2 - 2^3 - 10x + 9\n3. Simplify the subexpressions using parentheses: (4x^2) - (2^3) - (10x) + 9 = 8x^2 - 8\n4. Simplify the remaining equations by combining: 8x^2 - 8 = 3x^2 - 8\n5. Simplify the remaining equations by combining: 3x^2 - 8 = x^2 - 3x = 2x - 3\n6. Simplify if necessary: 2x - 3\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2x - 3.

The order of operations is often represented by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication / Division, Addition / Subtraction). When performing a multiple step arithmetic problem, mathematicians would typically start by performing any operations inside parentheses, then move on to operations with exponents and roots, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction. This approach helps to prevent errors and allows for easier symbol manipulation and algebraic expression manipulation systems. Additionally, some computer algebra systems use this order of operations convention to allow for more complex mathematical calculations to be performed.", "task_prompt": "Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.\n\nQ: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =\nA: Let's think step by step.\nLet\u2019s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right).

Break down the problem into smaller parts: Look for different parts of the problem that you can solve independently.\n\n2. Simplify the expressions: Use the order of operations to simplify the expressions. For example, exponentiation comes before multiplication and division, which come before addition and subtraction.\n\n3. Use the rules of algebra: If there are variables in the problem, you can use the rules of algebra to manipulate them.\n\n4. Check your work: After solving each part of the problem, check your work. Look for mistakes and make sure your calculations are correct.\n\n5. Use diagrams: Drawing a diagram or model of the problem can help you visualize the relationships between different parts of the problem.\n\n6. Practice regularly: Work on solving as many multi-step arithmetic problems as possible on a regular basis. This will help you develop your skills and get faster at solving these types of problems.", "task_prompt": "Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.\n\nQ: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =\nA: Let's think step by step.\nLet\u2019s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right).
