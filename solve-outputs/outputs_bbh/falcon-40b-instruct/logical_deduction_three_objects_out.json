Through logical deduction, students can learn how to organize information, make inferences, and evaluate conclusions. Additionally, these tasks can teach students how to identify and avoid cognitive biases, such as overgeneralization and stereotyping. It can also help students develop the ability to identify fallacious reasoning and recognize errors in reasoning. As a result, critical thinking skills are becoming increasingly important in today's information-based society and are essential for success in both academic and professional settings. Therefore, incorporating logical deduction tasks into education can be beneficial in preparing students for the challenges they are likely to face in the future.", "task_prompt": "A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.

For example, if \"John is older than Mary\" and \"Mary is younger than Jane\", then \"John\" is the oldest, \"Mary\" is the second-oldest, and \"Jane\" is the youngest.\n\n3. Eliminate the irrelevant statements: Look for statements that do not provide any information about the order of the objects. If a statement does not provide any additional information, it can be eliminated.\n\n4. Make a table or diagram to help visualize the relationships: A table or diagram can help organize the information and make it easier to see the relationships between the objects.\n\n5. Use logical reasoning to fill in missing information: If there is a relationship between two or more objects that is not directly stated, try to use logical reasoning to fill in the missing information. For example, if \"John is older than Mary\" and \"Jane is older than Mary\", then we know that \"John\" must be older than both \"Jane\" and \"Mary\".\n\nThe process of deducing the order of objects can be applied in other real-life situations that involve logical reasoning or problem-solving.

Therefore, if two propositions contradict one another, at least one of them must be false.\n- Contrapositives or the \"to-not\" principle: If a proposition is false, then its contrapositive is true. Conversely, if a proposition is true, then its contrapositive is false.\n- Negation or the \"excluded middle\" principle: An entirely true proposition (such as \"All men are mortal\") entails its negation (\"Some men are immortal\"). If it's not entirely true, it entails its negation.\n- Law of universal quantification: If every individual that falls under a certain external description is under an internal description, then every individual that falls under the external description is under the internal description.\n- Law of identity: A thing is identical to itself.\n- Law of contradiction: Any proposition and its negation are both false and cannot both be true. Therefore, if a proposition and its negation are both false, then the proposition must be false.\n- Law of excluded middle: Any proposition must either be true or false and cannot be both or neither.\n\nBy using these rules consistently, one can deduce the order of objects in any given scenario.", "task_prompt": "A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.

Read the problem carefully and try to identify the key facts or limitations. For example, in the question about the golfers, it is important to note that Amy and Eli are not tied for last, so one of them must be last.\n2. Look for internal contradictions or inconsistencies in the information provided. For example, in the question about the books, if the green book is to the left of the white book, then the white book must be to the left of the orange book.\n3. Try to organize the information in a way that makes sense to you. For example, in the branch question, it is helpful to make a diagram with the three birds at the vertices of a triangle.\n4. Use what you already know or can infer based on real-world knowledge. For example, if you know that a raven is generally larger than an owl, then you can infer that it is more likely to be in the middle than the left wing.\n\nRemember, logical deduction is not always straightforward and sometimes requires creative thinking and open-mindedness.

(expensive not expensive)\".\n(4) By backward elimination, we also get the ordering: \"(expensive mangoes ? expensive fruit expensive) cantaloupe ? (expensive not expensive)\".\n(5) (from step 4) Subtraction of these two provides \"(expensive mangoes ? expensive fruit) ? (cantaloupe not expensive)\". Therefore, we can eliminate the neutral middle node \"expensive not expensive\" in the first tree, which makes the ordering simpler.\n(6) Furthermore, \"cantaloupes\" are between \"mangoes\" and \"expensive not expensive\" (whichever one we eliminate), so they are neither cheap nor expensive. Therefore, the ordering cannot be \"(expensive mangoes expensive fruit expensive) ? (expensive cantaloupe) ? (expensive not expensive)\".\n(7) From (1) and (6) we have the ordering: \"expensive mangoes expensive fruit ? expensive cantaloupe ? (expensive not expensive)\".\nSince we have already eliminated \"expensive not expensive\", we have the final ordering of \"expensive mangoes expensive fruit expensive cantaloupe cheapest\".\nFrom this, we can derive that the expensive mangoes are the cheapest.

The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. This means that the order of the persons listed within each paragraph is correct.\n\n2. The order of the persons in each paragraph is irrelevant since their finish order (which determines the order of the paragraphs) is already fixed and known. Therefore, the order within each paragraph is also fixed.\n\n3. If Amy finished above Eli, then Eli must have finished below Amy.\n\n4. If Eli finished below Amy, then Amy must have finished above Eli.\n\n5. Combining (3) and (4), we get that Amy finished above Eli.\n\n6. If Amy finished above Eli, and Eve finished above Amy, then Eve finished above Eli.\n\n7. Combining (2) and (6), we get that Eve finished above Eli.\n\n8. Therefore, the answer is Option (A).\n\nFor the second one:\n\n1. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. This means that the order of the books listed within each paragraph is correct.\n\n2. The order of the books in each paragraph is irrelevant since their finish order (which determines the order of the paragraphs) is already fixed and known.

Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Jumping to Conclusions: Make sure that you avoid making assumptions about the order based on one statement alone. Each statement should be consistent with the others in the paragraph.\n\n2. Presumption of Directionality: Inferential choice relies on a presumption of directionality - believing that one thing usually comes before another. In this task, it is common for people to assume that \"above\" or \"left\" or \"right\" means the same thing in every paragraph, even though that's not always the case.\n\n3. Semantic Ambiguity: Make sure that you understand the meaning of all the terms in each sentence, and ensure that they are not synonymous with any other term in the paragraph.\n\n4. Negation: Negation is important in these types of tasks. If a list is presented in the context of a tournament or shelf, it is reasonable to assume that the order of the names is significant. This order could be reverse from what it would be in a qualifying round, for example, when the number of competitors may be larger.", "task_prompt": "A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
