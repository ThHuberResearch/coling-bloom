Identify the key relationship between the objects (e.g., Eve finished above Amy, Green book is to the right of white book).\n2. Combine the relationships to determine the overall order (e.g., Eve, Amy, Eli, White, Green, Orange, White, Red, Gray).\n3.

Therefore, the answer is (B).\n\n**Books on a Shelf:**\n- The green book is to the right of the white book.\n- The orange book is the rightmost.\nThe order is white, green, orange. Therefore, the answer is (A).\n\n**Books on a Shelf:**\n- The white book is to the left of the gray book.\n- The red book is the second from the left.\nThe order is white, red, gray. Therefore, the answer is (C).\n\n**Books on a Shelf:**\n- The black book is to the left of the purple book.\n- The purple book is to the left of the white book.\nThe order is black, purple, white. Therefore, the answer is (B).\n\nIn each paragraph, the key to deducing the order is to identify the logical relationships between the objects and then combine those relationships to arrive at the final order. The order in which the objects are arranged is always consistent with the statements provided in each paragraph.", "task_prompt": "<start_of_turn>system\nA logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.

Each paragraph describes a different scenario, but the overall approach to solving the problem is similar.\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify the key information:** Extract the important details from each paragraph, such as the order of the objects, the relationships between them, and any other relevant information.\n2. **Create a logical sequence:** Based on the key information, deduce the logical order of the objects. This involves identifying the order in which they must be arranged based on the relationships and statements provided.\n3. **Verify and conclude:** Once you have created the sequence, verify whether it is consistent with the statements for each paragraph. If it is, then conclude the answer based on the order of the objects in the sequence.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIn the first paragraph, the key information is:\n* Eve finished above Amy.\n* Eli finished below Amy.\n\nFollowing the above steps, the logical sequence is:\n* Eve finished above Amy.\n* Eli finished below Amy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).\n\n**Similarly:**\n\nIn the second paragraph, the key information is:\n* The green book is to the right of the white book.\n* The orange book is the rightmost.\n\nFollowing the steps above, the logical sequence is:\n* The white book is the leftmost.\n* The green book is to the right of the white book.\n* The orange book is the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n\nIn the third paragraph, the key information is:\n* The white book is to the left of the gray book.\n* The red book is the second from the left.\n\nFollowing the steps above, the logical sequence is:\n* The white book is to the left of the gray book.\n* The red book is the second from the left.\n* The gray book is the leftmost.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\n* It is important to read each paragraph carefully and understand the key information before making deductions.\n* Be logical and eliminate impossible options.\n* Verify your answer by ensuring that it is consistent with the statements for each paragraph.", "task_prompt": "<start_of_turn>system\nA logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
