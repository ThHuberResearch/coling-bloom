What is the total amount of money they saved from the membership costs alone?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nA club membership involves fixed dues, which in this case is $200 per year and a per month allowance, which is $20 per month.\nFirst, let's calculate the total yearly benefits from the clothing allowances. One year consists of 12 months, so the total benefits from the clothing allowances in a year would be $20 * 12 = $240.\nIf the member availed the benefits for all 12 months in the year, the total savings would be the original membership cost of $200 that they would have had to pay without the benefits.\nThe saved amount from membership costs alone therefore only can be $200.\n\nQ: The manager at a furniture department of a large retail home store wants to calculate the number of producers' profit on an exclusive store design of a new collection of wood tables.

What was the integer number of producers' profit in percent?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe store's expected cost (C) isn't given, so let's denote it as C.\nThe price without profit (P1) is given as 95% of C, so P1 = 0.95C.\nThe price with profit (P3) is given as 108% of C, so P3 = 1.08C.\n\nThe profit (P2) is the difference between the price with profit and the price without profit, so P2 = P3 - P1.\nSubstituting the values for P1 and P3 we get, P2 = 1.08C - 0.95C = 0.13C.\nThis profit as a percentage of the cost is given by (P2/C) * 100% = 13%\n\nSo, the integer number of producers' profit in percent is 13.", "task_prompt": "<|system|>Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.\n\nQ: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =\nA: Let's think step by step.\nLet\u2019s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right).

Within this expression, there is a multiplication operation between -3 and 5. According to rule 3 (multiplication before addition/subtraction), this gets calculated first. So, -3 * 5 = -15. Inserting this into C, we get (-8 - -15 + 4), still following rule 3 (additions and subtractions from left to right). So, the equation becomes (-8 + 15 + 4) which evaluates to 11. Hence C = 11. \n\nNow, onto expression D. The multiplication (2 * 7) equates to 14. Inserting this into the equation gives 14 - -3 - -1. Similarly to C, we must perform operations from left to right according to rules. So, 14 - -3 is 17 and then 17 - -1 which equals 18.

Derivatives are computed using the power rule which says that the derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1).\nLet's first find the derivative of the function f(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx[4x^2 - 3x + 2] = 2*(4)*x^(2-1) - 1*(3)*x^(1-1) + 0 = 8x - 3.\nNow, let's plug x=1 into f'(x) to find f'(1): f'(1) = 8*1 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5.\n\nSo your answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: For the equation y = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 1, determine the value of y when x is equal to -2.\nA: Let's think step by step.\nWe're given the function y = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 1 and asked to find the value of y when x equals -2.

It states that if x_n is the current guess, the next guess x_(n+1) is given by:\nx_(n+1) = x_n - (f(x_n) / f'(x_n)).\n\nWe start with x_0 = 2. Let's find x_1, x_2, and x_3, each within two iterations.\n\nFirst, calculate f'(x) by differentiating, \nf'(x) = d/dx[3x^4 - 4x^3 + x^2 - x + 1] = 12x^3 - 12x^2 + 2x - 1.\n\nNow, apply Newton\u2019s method starting with x_0 = 2:\n\nx_1 = x_0 - (f(x_0) / f'(x_0)) = 2 - ((3*(2)^4 - 4*(2)^3 + (2)^2 - 2 + 1) / (12*(2)^3 - 12*(2)^2 + 2*2 - 1)).\nx_1 = 2 - ((48 - 32 + 4 - 1 + 1) / (80 - 48 + 4 - 1)) = 2 - (19 / 35).\nx_1 \u2248 0.46 (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n\nNow, calculate x_2:\nx_2 = x_1 - (f(x_1) / f'(x_1))\nWe first calculate f(x_1) and f'(x_1) using their respective expressions. Then substitute these values into the equation above to find x_2.\nI encourage you to compute the value yourself as it requires several iterations of substitution.\n\nRepeat the method a final time to find x_3:\nUsing the formula, calculate f(x_2) and f'(x_2).\nThen, substitute these values into the equation above to find x_3.\nI again encourage you to perform these calculations for practice.\n\nThese steps will guide how to use Newton's method in finding roots. Note that Newton\u2019s method does not guarantee finding exact solutions; one must be careful to run enough iterations or verify the findings using a different method if necessary.\n\nThe correct answer depends on the exact calculations during the iterations.
